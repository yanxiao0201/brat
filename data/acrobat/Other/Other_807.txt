A 78-year-old man weighing 87 kg, taking warfarin 13 mg per week (2 mg Mondayâ€”Saturday, 1 mg Sunday), verapamil, losartan and atorvastatin, attended urology outpatients department because of macroscopic haematuria. His venous INR was 4.4. Computed tomography scan identified a renal cyst and warfarin was discontinued to allow biopsy. Six days later, when the patient attended for renal biopsy, his INR was 4.3, despite him confirming compliance with 5 days of warfarin withdrawal as advised in the standard protocol of warfarin interruption . When he returned for biopsy after a further 12 days without warfarin, his INR was 1.1. Genotyping revealed him to have heterozygous mutations (*2*3) for the CYP2C9 gene. A 71-year-old man, weighing 86 kg, taking warfarin 14 mg per week (2 mg daily), bisoprolol, ramipril and simvastatin, was admitted 1 day before planned ureteric stone extraction.
