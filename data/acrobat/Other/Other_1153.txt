A full-term infant boy was born by elective cesarean delivery to nonconsanguineous parents, who conceived by in vitro fertilization technique after 6 years of infertility. The mother's height was 160 cm (BMI of 32). The mother, before conception and during pregnancy, was not following a restrictive diet. Antenatal fetal growth was normal. There were no risk factors for infection. The infant's weight was 2.6 kg (3rd to 15th percentile), length was 49 cm (15th to 50th percentile), and head circumference was 35 cm (50th percentile) plotted on World Health Organization child growth standards. His Apgar score was 9 at 1 minute and 10 at 5 minutes. Shortly after birth he developed subcostal recession, grunting, wet cough, and desaturations requiring up to 50% oxygen.
