A 55-year-old white woman was referred for evaluation of incidentally discovered 6.1 cm aneurysm of the descending thoracic aorta . The patient reported palpitations, chest pain, heartburn, and nonbloody diarrhea in the previous week, and was initially evaluated in the emergency department of another hospital. Computed tomography (CT) scanning of the thoracic aorta to rule out an aortic dissection revealed the descending thoracic aortic aneurysm (DTAA) with mural thrombus. The images were notable for atherosclerotic plaque without focal ulceration or occlusive mesenteric arterial disease. The patient denied a history of chest pain, abdominal pain, stroke, or claudication. There was no history of trauma, aortitis, or known cardiovascular disease. But there was a positive family history, as her father had had coronary artery disease; the patient did not know if her father also had aneurysms or peripheral vascular disease.
