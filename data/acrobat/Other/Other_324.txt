A 65-year-old white woman was admitted to Padua Hospital with severe dyspnea associated with mild leg edema. The clinical history revealed painful cervical and lumbar hernias treated for 10 years with ibuprofen 600 mg three times daily. Eight years earlier she had a transient ischemic attack. Clinical examination showed tachypnea, tachycardia and blood hypotension. Blood analysis showed an elevated D-dimer value (1231 lg/l, normal range 0–225), a slight anemia (hemoglobin 104 g/l), decreased iron concentration (7.4 lmol/l normal 9–30.4) and elevated levels of C-reactive protein (10.2 mg/l). Markers of inherited or acquired thrombophilia were negative, as were markers of occult cancer. Spiral computed tomography showed bilateral pulmonary embolism with the involvement of lobar and segmentary ramifications of both pulmonary arteries .During hospitalization she underwent gastroscopy and colonoscopy, which showed hemorrhagic gastritis and a few aspecific ulcers of the sigma, respectively. An echography of abdomen and pelvis was normal, as was ultrasonography of the deep vein system of the legs. A spine magnetic resonance evidenced cervical and lumbar discal hernias. The patient was treated with therapeutic doses of LMWH for 1 week, followed by full-dose rivaroxaban (15 mg twice daily for 2 weeks and then 20 mg once daily). Ibuprofen was discontinued and replaced by tramadol, in association with pantoprazole.
