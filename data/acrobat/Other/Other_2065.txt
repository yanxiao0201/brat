A six-year-old developed an infected thoracic pseudoaneurysm following aortic coarctation surgery (
. The lesion embolised to the aortic bifurcation and the right superficial femoral artery. The thoracic pseudoaneurysm was managed by resection and synthetic patch repair. Aspergillus infection was diagnosed by tissue culture. Control of infection was achieved using the antifungal drugs liposomal amphotericin B and voriconazole for six weeks. The patient subsequently developed mycotic aortoiliac aneurysms ( . Following a further period of antifungal treatment, these were resected. The superficial femoral veins were considered too small to be used for deep venous reconstruction and biological grafts were not available. Reconstruction was achieved using a synthetic (6mm polyethylene terephthalate), bifurcated, silver coated graft (
. At eight months, the aorto bi-iliac graft thrombosed and bilateral femoral thrombectomies were performed. A simultaneous bypass of the lower limb occlusion was performed using autologous vein. Imaging revealed that the arterial supply to both lower limbs had remained patent (
. However, by this time, the thoracic aortic repair was associated with significant inflammation ( . Resection of the diseased thoracic aortic segment was undertaken using a synthetic graft (20mm polyethylene terephthalate) impregnated with voriconazole as insufficient biological material was available to replace the diseased intrathoracic segment. Oral antifungal treatment continues indefinitely. Followup review at 48 months revealed patent revascularisation, no recurrence of the aneurysms and no recrudescence of sepsis or elevation in inflammatory markers.
