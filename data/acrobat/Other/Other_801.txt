Following pancreatic surgery, a false aneurysm of the distal third of the lineal artery was detected on helical CT with a diameter of 3.8 cm. The perfused lumen was 1.6 cm with an aneurysmal neck of 0.4 cm in diameter ( , B). Due to tortuosity of the splenic artery the endovascular access seemed to be challenging. Therefore, we decided to use a percutaneous route. Blood chemistry prior to the intervention excluded a coagulation disorder (INR: 0.9; PTT: 32 sec; PC: 274000/Î¼l). We placed a G18 needle by ultrasound guidance ( near the aneurysmal neck. The correct localisation was proven by trans-needle angiography . By fl uoroscopic guidance, 2 fi bred vascular coils (MWCE-35-10/5Tornado, Cook, Bloomington, USA) were implanted through the puncture needle in the perfused aneurysmal lumen . A 3rd coil was misplaced in the aneurysmal thrombus due to dislocation of the needle. As colorcoded ultrasound revealed residual perfusion, the needle was repositioned and 500 IU thrombin (Tissucol, Baxter,
