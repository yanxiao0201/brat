The case of a 71-year-old woman is reported. She presented erythematous violaceous papules on the back and buttocks; hardened, symmetrical erythematous violaceous nodules, some ulcerated, on the elbows, hands and feet; and ulcerated malleolar tumoral lesion for two years, accompanied by pain and pruritus (Figures 1 to 3). The patient mentioned progressive increase of lesions. The histopathological examination evidenced intense dermal neutrophilic infi ltrate, diffuse and permeating vessel walls, which showed fi brinoid alterations and occasional leukocytoclasia, compatible with leukocytoclastic vasculitis . Laboratory investigation included complete blood count, renal, hepatic and thyroid function, protein electrophoresis, serologies for syphilis, HIV and hepatitides, rheumatoid factor, antinuclear antibody, glycemia, P-ANCA and C-ANCA, all without abnormal results except for TSH and free T4, compatible with hypothyreoidism and high levels of anti-thyroglobulin and anti-peroxidase antibodies. Abdominal and transvaginal ultrasound, colonoscopy and X-ray of the thorax and long bones had normal results. The data revealed in the tests confi rmed the EED diagnosis and the treatment was begun with dapsone, intralesional corticosteroids and levothyroxine. The patient is being followed and presents unsatisfactory response to therapy.
