unacceptably high for both . Optimal therapy involves the removal of the infected graft and reconstruction of the aorta, in combination with intensive antibiotic therapy, although graft preservation should be considered as an alternative treatment option, especially in high-risk patients . In this report, we present a rare case of a complicated endograft infection in which we were able to perform hybrid treatment consisting of in situ reconstruction following percutaneous computed tomography (CT)-guided intervention. The patient was a 52-year-old male who had undergone graft placement (GR) in the proximal descending thoracic dissected aorta (DA) 6 years previously for a dissecting aortic aneurysm. Two years previously, he underwent hybrid surgery for a ruptured abdominal DA (max diameter 50 mm) and residual thoracoabdominal DA (max diameter 55 mm). The hybrid surgery consisted of GR at the abdominal aortic aneurysm using a prosthetic graft of 30-mm Triplex (Vascutek Terumo Ltd., Inchinnan, Scotland), in addition to visceral and renal bypass grafting with cross-shaped composite vascular grafts (10-mm Gelsoft graft, Vascutek Terumo Ltd., Inchinnan, Scotland; and 6-mm Gore-Tex graft, W.L. Gore and Associates, Flagstaff, Arizona), the inflow portion of which was anastomosed into the distal portion of the abdominal graft. Subsequent endovascular surgery was performed using two GORE TAG endografts (W.L. Gore and Associates, Flagstaff, Arizona) for the aneurysm between the mid-portion of the descending thoracic aorta and just above the abdominal graft, measuring 37 mm × 15 cm and 34 mm × 15 cm, respectively .
