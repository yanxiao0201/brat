A total of 6 patients (5 males) with refractory macular edema resulting from CRVO were identified in the Medical Retina Unit of Jules-Gonin University Eye Hospital from September 2013 to February 2014. Due to the short follow-up after the switch, one patient was excluded from the analysis. The mean age at baseline was 57 Â± 12 years. Four patients had a history of cardiovascular disease. Three patients had ophthalmic predispositions to vein occlusion (two patients with pigmentary dispersion syndrome, one patient with narrow angle).
