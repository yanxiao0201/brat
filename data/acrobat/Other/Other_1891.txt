A 64-year-old asymptomatic woman with breast cancer was referred to our institution. She had no past medical history of note. Her heart rate was 95 bpm, and her blood pressure was 90/60 mmHg. An electrocardiogram, chest X-ray, and laboratory tests revealed no abnormal findings. Chest contrast computed tomography (CT) to detect metastasis incidentally revealed a mass occupying most of the right atrium . Axial plane CT suggested the presence of calcification and bleeding . We suspected a large myxoma because the mass was spherical and welldemarcated, but could not rule out the possibility of metastatic cancer. Treatment strategies for primary and metastatic cancers differ substantially. We therefore employed additional modalities to distinguish between these possibilities. Transthoracic and transesophageal echocardiography showed a large well-demarcated mass with a neck from the atrial septum ( , upper image). Inflow to the right ventricle was observed on both sides of the mass ( , lower image). Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) revealed an isointense signal in T1-weighted images, a heterogeneous hyperintense signal in T2-weighted images ( , left and upper right images, respectively). No jet was observed on cine magnetic resonance imaging using the gradient echo technique ( , lower right image), and no enhancement was observed in perfusion images. Angiography showed feeding arteries . These findings supported a diagnosis of atrial myxoma. Although the patient's hemodynamics were stable, there was a risk of sudden deterioration; cardiac surgery was therefore a higher priority than breast cancer surgery. Weperformed a right atrial mass excision and pericardial patch implantation without complication 3 days after CT. Myxoma was pathologically diagnosed based on the findings of myxomatous interstitium, calcification, and severe bleeding .
