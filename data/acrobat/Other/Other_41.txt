The delivery room of the hospital was located in a wing several floors from the main operating room; perfusion supplies and the ECMO equipment needed to be transported quickly. Peripheral ECMO cannulation via the femoral vessels was decided upon as it would be the fastest method to initiate ECMO and still allow for CPR to continue. A 17 Fr. Biomedicus (Medtronic, Minneapolis, MN, USA) arterial cannula and a 21 Fr. Multiport (Medtronic) venous cannula were chosen for cannulation. The ECMO circuit was assembled in the Delivery Room and contained a Quadrox D (Maquet, Hirrlingen, Germany) oxygenator, a Rotaflow (Maquet) centrifugal pump and tubing with Biolineâ„¢ coating (Maquet). At 84 minutes into the resuscitation, the patient was placed on V-A ECMO through a cut-down of the left groin, using only the surgical instruments available on the obstetriimproved and the patient was converted from V-A ECMO to a single, dual-lumen Avalon cannula for veno-venous (V-V) ECMO through the right internal jugular vein. It was felt that the lungs required more time to recover, therefore, V-V ECMO was used. The patient was weaned from V-V ECMO successfully on post-operative day (POD) 4. The duration of ECMO was 3.5 days (81 hours). The patient required 4 cannulation sites to optimize flow and perfusion with changing clinical conditions. On POD 46, the patient was discharged from hospital without any physical or neurological sequelae.
