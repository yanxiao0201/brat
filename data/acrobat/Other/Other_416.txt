A 43-year-old woman was admitted to the Ophthalmology Department because of vision loss in her left eye for 20 days after single sudden syncope (lasting for about ten seconds; Overlooked by an ophthalmologist at a local hospital). Before admission, she had received treatment by the ophthalmologist at the local hospital, however without improvement. On admission, she was found with visual acuities of 20/25 OD and fingers OS. Intraocular pressure was 16 mmHg OD and 13 mmHg OS. The visual field of the left eye was defected with poor pupillary light reflex. Fundus examination of the left eye showed obscure boundary of optic disc with reflective dispersion of the retina and poor light reflex of central fovea. Fluorescein angiographic imaging showed a left retinal artery occlusion . A transthoracic echocardiography revealed a tumor in the left atrial . She had no prior history of cardiac disease. No ischemic infarct, vertebrobasilar artery insufficiency or other diseases were found after examination. The patient was transferred to the Cardiac Surgical ward for surgery. The physical examination was normal with a blood pressure of 124/70 mmHg and heart rate 57 bpm. Electrocardiogram showed sinus bradycardia, and chestX-ray showed a normal cardiac silhouette. Bilateral carotid and vertebral artery ultrasound showed no abnormalities. Cerebral MRI revealed no abnormalities. A complete blood count, liver and kidney tests, electrolyte analysis, blood coagulation, myocardial enzymes and blood gas analysis were all normal. The patient underwent minimally invasive percutaneous cardiopulmonary bypass for open heart exploration and the left atrial myxoma. Histology of the excised tissue confirmed left cardiac myxoma . The postoperative course was uneventful and the patient was discharged one week after surgery. She was stable at 12month follow-up, and her visual acuities improved to 20/400 OS.
