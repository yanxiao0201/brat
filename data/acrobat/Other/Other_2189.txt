A 38-year-old female patient was admitted to the hospital after suffering upper abdomen pain and fatigue for about 1 week in 2011. She has no history of smoking and alcohol or drug abuse. The patient denied immunodeficiency, history of malignancy and toxin exposure, and family
) has been performed for further examination. The result showed splenomegaly with multifocal low-density lesions. Other organs including liver, pancreas, renal, and adrenal were normal. Considering possibility of splenic neoplasm, and for further clarification, splenectomy was carried out. Histopathology  evaluation showed well-formed anastomosing vessel channels and proliferated endothelial cell with mild atypia but inconspicuously malignant. Immunohistochemistry  revealed positive staining of CD31and CD34 but negative staining of factor VIII, CD68, p53. The pathology findings supported the diagnosis of hemangioma. Although no necrosis or hemorrhage was found in macroscopic and histological examination, in consideration of splenomegaly and anastomosing capillary-sized vessels, the well-differentiated angiosarcoma cannot be excluded. After splenectomy, the patient was quickly relieved from the pain and discharged without any postoperative complications. Then, the patient got lost to follow-up. Two years after splenectomy in December 2013, the patient presented with worsening upper abdomen pain, fatigue, and frequent dizziness for 3 months. On physical examination, she showed severe anemic appearance. There were no clinically palpable node and no papilledema. There was no evidence of bruising and easy bleeding. The initial lab tests were as follows: low hemoglobin (45 g/L, normal range 113–151), an increase of D-dimer, 78,700 ug/L (normal range 0–700ug/L), and a mild increase of aspartate aminotransferase (AST), 48 U/L (normal range 8–40U/L). Further examination of upper abdominal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was implemented. The result  showed multiple nodes in the liver and accessory spleen with rich blood supply and signals of intratumoral hemorrhage. With these findings in MRI, fine-needle biopsy was obtained of the hepatic lesions. Due to further clarification of anemia, bone marrow trephine biopsy as well as smear for cytological examination were performed. The pathology evaluation  on hepatic demonstrated a small amount of proliferated endothelial cells. The result of pathology findings of bone marrow biopsy  showed anastomosing vascular channels, proliferated endothelial cells with few mitotic figures and mild nuclear atypia. The similarity of pathological findings in the liver, spleen, and bone marrow and clinical image presentation supported that the final diagnosis was well-differentiated angiosarcoma of the spleen with bone and liver metastasis. The patient was initially treated with analgesia and blood transfusion. Because few data can be acquired to guide chemotherapy and poor therapeutic effect, she gave up further chemotherapy after discussing with her family members. She wasdischarged in a few days after slight relief from pain and fatigue. Follow-up showed she passed away 3 months after discharge. DNA was extracted from ten 20-μm thick ribbons of paraffin-embedded tumor of spleen from FFPE tissue blocks using DNeasy Blood &Tissue Kit (Cat#69506, QIAGEN, GmBH, Germany), following the manufacturer's instructions. A total of 80 ng sample of DNA was sent for processing via OconScanTM FFPE Express 2.0 service as manufacturer's instructions. The OncoScan assay contains more than 300,000 copy number and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) oligonucleotide probes with a median probe spacing of 4200 kb, with 541 somatic mutations for known cancer genes. The arrays were scanned by GeneChip® Scanner 3000 (Cat#00-00212, Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA, USA) and Command Console Software 3.1 (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA, USA) with default settings. Raw data that passed quality control were further analyzed by Affymetrix® OconScan Analysis Suite (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA, USA). Statistical analysis of the CGH data was performed by FASST2 Segmentation method. In order to adjust the sensitivity of the segmentation algorithm, we determined the significant threshold at 1.0E-8, specified 1000 kb being max contiguous probe spacing. The minimum number of probes per segment required to Tumor in spleen shows well-formed anastomosing vessel channels (a, HE 100×), proliferated endothelial cells with mild atypia (b, HE 400×), immunohistochemistry revealed positive staining of CD31 (c, 100×) and CD34 (d, 100×). Tumor cells from bone biopsy showed anastomosing vessel channels with proliferated endothelial cells without obvious malignant as that in spleen (e, HE 100×; f, HE 400×). Tumor cells from liver biopsy showed a handful of endothelial cells without obvious malignant (g, HE 100×) eliminate small CNVs was five; gains and losses were defined at ±3 × SD of all probes, and the threshold was adjusted at ±0.5 for both. Copy number change of this angiosarcoma of spleen sample showed diverse DNA copy number alternations including copy number loss, copy number gain, and homozygous copy loss. The copy number changes were summarized in . The result (
and
) revealed that copy number gain at 11q23.2, 11q24.3, 12q24.33, 13q34, copy number loss at 1q24.2-q31.3, 1q41-q42.2, 1 q42.3-q43, 2q36.3q37.3, 2q37.7, 3q13.33-q26.2, 3q28-q29, 9p11.2, 13q11, 15q11, homozygous copy loss at 8p11.22, 22q11.23. We found that a total of 1067 genes were affected by copy number changes according to the result of aCGH. In order to discuss the probably functions of altered genes, 397 out of 1067 genes with known biological functions, we used the Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery (DAVID) v6.7 (free online bioinformatics resources at http:// david.abcc.ncifcrf.gov/) to clustered Gene Ontology (GO) group. The enriched GO groups  were ranked according to statistical significance measured by EASE score (EASE score = −LgP), a modified Fish's exact p value. The result illustrates that five relevant pathways have been affected by copy number changes as EASE score upper than 0.1. It is noteworthy that renin-angiotensin system and ECM-receptor interaction pathways exhibit statistically EASE score (p < 0.05).
