We describe the case of a 78-year old lady who underwent redosternotomy for mitral valve repair, tricuspid valve annuloplasty and left atrial appendage closure. Postoperative course was uncomplicated and the patient was discharged home in good condition. About 8 weeks after the operation, the patient was re-admitted for management of new onset atrial fibrillation, shortness of breath and congestive heart failure with peripheral oedema. Clinical examination also revealed a left parasternal swelling ( and B). Chest ultrasound showed a 3 cm Ã— 3 cm pseudoaneurysm arising within the anterior chest wall and in left parasternal position; the neck of the aneurysm was seen to stretch into the chest wall measuring up to 6 mm and appeared to be arising from the left IMA. At that stage, a CT angiogram confirmed the presence of a false aneurysm in the anterior chest lying adjacent to the left side of the sternum and at the level of the first sternal segment. The aneurysm was fed by a very small intercostal branch of the left IMA, it was ovoid and its maximum diameter was 36 mm with a rather extensive thrombus within it ( and D). The patient was then referred to cardiologists and embolization of pseudoaneurysm was performed . A postembolization chest ultrasound confirmed that the communication between the pseudoaneurysm and the left IMA was no longer present and the pseudoaneurysm was almost completely thrombosed. The patient was then discharged home and followed up 6 weeks later in our outpatient clinic where she presented in good condition and the parasternal swelling was reduced in calibre.
