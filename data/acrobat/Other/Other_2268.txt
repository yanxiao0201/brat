In July 2013, a previously healthy 15-year-old Korean girl presented with abdominal pain and bile-colored vomiting, which began 6 days prior. She had poor food intake since the onset of symptoms. Her urine output started decreasing daily before hospital transfer. She lost approximately 6kg in a week (from 46kg to 40kg). There was no sign of purpura. Her blood pressure (BP) was high (130/90mmHg), heart rate was 114 beats/minute, respiratory rate was 22 breaths/minute, and temperature was 37.5°C. However, laboratory and urine analysis results indicated no significant abnormalities, except 1+ proteinuria due to dehydration. On hospital day (HD) 1, an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) was performed, and diffuse superficial ulceration with whitish membrane and mucosal bleeding was noted in the descending and transverse portion of her duodenum . A purplish and reddish mucosal edema was also noted, indicating hemorrhagic duodenitis and duodenal vasculitis due to HSP. IMPT (60mg/day, 1mg/kg/day to a maximum of 60 to 80mg/day) and intravenous pantoprazole/ranitidine (gastric acid pump inhibiter/H 2-blocker) were administered because of difficulties with oral intake. Intravenous pethidine and morphine were used for pain control but were ineffective. On HD 4, a second EGD was performed because of worsening abdominal pain. The previous lesion had slightly improved. However, diffuse superficial ulceration with edematous and dark brownish mucosa was noted in the descending and transverse portions of her duodenum. Under the presumptive diagnosis of duodenal vasculitis caused by HSP, high-dose IVIg was administered (2g/kg/day). On HD 7, she experienced dyspnea and persistent abdominal pain. She had an acutely ill appearance. Her BP and temperature increased to 140/80mmHg and 38.3°C, respectively. Her serum was negative for antinuclear antibody and anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody. Serum complements 3 and 4 (132mg/dL and 16mg/dL, respectively) were within normal limits. Serum IgG, IgA, and IgM levels were 3629mg/dL (normal range, 639 to 1349mg/dL), 162mg/dL (normal range, 70 to 312mg/ dL), and 139mg/dL (normal range, 56 to 352mg/dL), respectively. Urine analysis revealed microscopic hematuria. An abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan showed an edematous bowel . Intravenous cefotaxime was added because of her persistent high fever and inflammation. IMPT (60mg/day) was discontinued because of pancreatitis. On HD 11, purpura developed on both of her ankles and feet . Her temperature was still high (38.2°C). A laboratory examination still showed an elevated white blood cell count (WBC; 22,200/μL) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR; 64mm/hour). Her amylase, lipase, and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels increased to 190IU/L, 210U/L, and 17.14mg/dL, respectively. Since pancreatitis had not improved after discontinuing IMPT, we readministered low-dose IMPT (0.5mg/kg/day). On HD 14, her abdominal pain was aggravated, but the purpura disappeared. She still had a fever (38.0°C). Her laboratory results showed a much higher WBC (34,700/μL) and a declined but abnormal ESR (15mm/hour) and amylase (74IU/L), lipase (62U/L), and CRP (8.16mg/dL) levels. However, her random urine protein to creatinine ratio (UP/Cr) value of 0.41 had slightly increased. Because of her aggravated abdominal pain, an emergency abdominal CT scan was performed, showing more severe bowel edema. Consequently, the IMPT dose was increased to 1 to 2mg/kg/day, with the addition of intravenous metronidazole. On HD 17, the second IVIg was infused (2g/kg).On HD 20, her fever and abdominal pain persisted, and gross hematuria (GHU) developed. Laboratory results showed the following abnormalities: WBC count, 23,600/μL; ESR, 67mm/hour; amylase, 125IU/dL; lipase, 104U/L; and CRP, 6.41mg/dL. The random UP/Cr had elevated to 2.15. The antibiotic was switched to piperacillin and tazobactam to eradicate the infection. A kidney biopsy was performed. Finally, a decision was made to administer high-dose IMPT for 3 days consecutively. The renal biopsy showed an increased glomerulus size, segment hypercellularity, 9% segmental loop necrosis on light microscopy, mesangial deposits on electron microscopy, and IgA 3+ on immunofluorescence microscopy. Overall, the biopsy revealed grade II HSP nephritis according to the International Study of Kidney Disease in Children grading system , and HSP nephritis was confirmed . After the course of high-dose IMPT, her abdominal pain and fever dramatically disappeared. On HD 30, an oral, not intravenous, steroid (1mg/kg/day to a maximum of 60 to 80mg/day) was administered, because the patient was able to eat. GHU and proteinuria persisted. Therefore, enalapril was prescribed for the proteinuria (5mg daily), and she was discharged. The oral steroid was discontinued after 6 months, and only enalapril was continued for an additional 2 months. Urine analysis results at the last follow-up in April 2014 were as follows: proteins, negative; red blood cells, 1 to 4/high-power field; and UP/Cr, 0.047.
