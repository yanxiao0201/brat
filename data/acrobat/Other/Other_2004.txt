A 49-year-old man was transferred to the emergency room from another hospital because of symptoms of increasing lethargy. After an intravenous infusion of dopamine hydrochloride (1.9 μg/kg/min), his blood pressure and heart rate were 84/50 mmHg and 120 beats/min, respectively. He had a recent 3-month history of weight loss, and a recent 1month history of fatigue, polydipsia, and polyuria. Furthermore, he had a history of hypertension, was a current smoker. However, he had no history of diabetes, cardiovascular disease, or hypercoagulable states such as antiphospholipid syndrome. His laboratory tests revealed serum glucose levels of 1,257 mg/dL, serum osmolality of 371 mOsm/kg H2O, creatinine levels of 3.73 mg/dL, and arterial blood gas at pH 7.25 ( . Electrocardiography showed sinus tachycardia. The patient was diagnosed with diabetes and DKA, and was admitted to the intensive care unit for treatment. However, 20 hours after admission he developed sudden acute abdominal pain, and a subsequent blood test revealed a D-dimer level of 428 μg/mL (normal: 0-1.0 μg/ mL), fibrinogen level of 369 mg/dL (normal: 170-360 mg/ dL), and fibrinogen degradation products (FDP) level of 915.6 μg/mL (normal: 0-9.9 μg/mL). Based on these results, acute thrombosis was suspected. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) revealed multiple thromboses in the superior mesenteric artery (SMA), superior mesenteric vein (SMV), and splenic artery (SA). In addition, edema was observed in the intestinal wall within the limits of the
). Intravenous heparin was therefore initiated at 20,000 U/day, and the necrotic intestines were promptly resected. During surgery, ultrasonography revealed an absence of blood flow to the lower right foot, and a thrombectomy of the right femoral artery was performed on the same day. Pathological examination revealed thickened intima of atherosclerotic arteries; however, the causal thrombus could not be sufficiently evaluated. Although arterial blood flow to the
