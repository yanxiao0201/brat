Rodrigues José et al. ESD of superficial rectal lesion over a varix … Endoscopy 2015; 47: E633–E634 villous adenoma with high grade dysplasia. ESD is a minimally invasive, organ-sparing, endoscopic technique that allows en bloc resection of premalignant and early malignant lesions of the gastrointestinal tract, regardless of size, and thus avoiding surgical morbidity . The risks associated with surgery are particularly high in patients with liver cirrhosis . In contrast, ESD seems to be effective and safe for treatment of early gastric neoplastic lesions in this patient population . Moreover, ESD has been successfully performed after band ligation in patients with superficial esophageal squamous cell carcinoma lying over esophageal varices . However, to our knowledge, this is the first report to describe ESD for the successful treatment of a superficial rectal lesion over a rectal varix.
