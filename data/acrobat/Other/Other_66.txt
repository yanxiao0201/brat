Personal history: asthma since the age of eight. Physical examination: good general condition, pale; palate with painful ulceration in healing phase, ptosis of the left eyelid and two ulcers with infi ltrative borders of 2cm and 3cm, clean background, on left zygomatic area; wheezing at lung bases; extremity with edema and ulcer of 5 cm located in the right leg.

Renal anatomopathological examination of clusters with increasing cell, fi brinoid necrosis foci, partial sclerosis of glomeruli and immunofl uorescence with no deposits of immunoglobulins, complement fraction and fi brinogen, compatible with related standard c-ANCA. Laboratory tests showed leukocytosis with neutrophilia of 89% and C-ANCA 1:20.
