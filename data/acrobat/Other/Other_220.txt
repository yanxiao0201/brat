Our first case is a 46-year-old man who developed acute weakness of the right limbs following 10-day paroxysmal dizziness. At admission, brain MRI showed multiple new foci of restricted diffusion suggesting acute stroke . MR T1-weighted fat-suppressed image  and catheter angiography  demonstrated bilateral internal carotid and left vertebral arterial dissections. Further genetic study identified a homozygous mutation in exon 30 of the COL3A1: c.2092G[A, confirming the diagnosis of Ehlersâ€“Danlos syndrome (EDS) IV. The second case is a 43-year-old woman admitted to our department due to headache, right acute hemiplegia and aphasia. Cranial MRI demonstrated a left middle cerebral artery territory lesion . Catheter angiography showed stenosis of left internal carotid artery with a configuration compatible with arterial dissection . Laboratory tests to determine etiology were normal except for positive anti-La antibody. Further biopsy of the salivary gland was concordant with Sjogren's syndrome (SS). The patient's symptoms relieved dramatically after three-week anticoagulation and steroid treatments.
