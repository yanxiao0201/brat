The patient is a 48-year-old woman with a medical history significant for end-stage renal disease secondary to diabetes and hypertension. The patient has a surgical history remarkable for multiple upper extremity and internal jugular (IJ) venous catheter placements for dialysis access over a period of several years. The patient presented with acute shortness of breath and swelling of the neck and face. Bilateral upper extremity ultrasound and venous-phase chest CTA (injection rate 4 mL/sec via left antecubital fossa access, 2 minute delay) demonstrated complete lack of flow in the right internal jugular (IJ), subclavian, and brachiocephalic veins, as well as near-occlusive acute thrombus in the left IJ, subclavian, and brachiocephalic veins surrounding an indwelling left IJ central venous catheter (not shown). Findings were confirmed on subsequent fluoroscopic venogram . The patient was treated with venoplasty and stenting of the left brachiocephalic vein. In addition to subclavian and brachiocephalic vein thrombosis, the chest CTA also demonstrated filling of perivertebral venous collaterals with wedge-like and nodular enhancement of the T2â€“T4 vertebral bodies and their associated basivertebral venous plexi (Figs. 2, 3). Contrast-enhanced D. BerrittoCT (CECT) of the neck (injection rate 2 mL/sec via left antecubital fossa access, 40 second delay) obtained 1 day prior to the chest CTA did not demonstrate any osseous abnormalities , and the patient had no known history of
