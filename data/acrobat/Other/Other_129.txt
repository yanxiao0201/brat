Sakurai Á T. Miyairi Department of Cardiovascular Surgery, St. Marianna University, School of Medicine, 2-16-1, Sugao, Miyamae-ku, Kawasaki 216-8511, Japan for infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) (maximum short diameter, 47 mm) 2 years previously. After EVAR, residual T2EL was identified from the inferior mesenteric artery (IMA) and several lumbar arteries, over time leading to aneurysm expansion (maximum short diameter, 55 mm). TAE was attempted, but the aneurysm sac could not be reached with a catheter because of the complex collateral circulation from the iliolumbar arteries to the lumbar arteries. TAE was discontinued and DP was scheduled, but translumbar and transabdominal approaches were considered too difficult because no safe route could be ensured. DP using a transpedicular approach for ISOP was therefore planned. Patient informed consent was obtained before the procedure. Because this method is the application of percutaneous vertebroplasty (PVP) which was approved by the Ethics Committee at our institution, approval of the Ethics Committee was waived for this procedure.
