An 87-year old man was admitted to a previous hospital with progressive dysphagia, regurgitation and aspiration pneumonia. His medical history included hypertension and TAA for 20 years. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) showed a giant saccular-shaped descending aorta compressed into the oesophagus . A high-attenuating crescent sign was observed around the TAA, and this led us to suspect an impending rupture of the TAA. He was immediately transferred to our hospital. The patient's physical examination and electrocardiographic finding were unremarkable. A chest X-ray revealed a mild bilateral infiltrative shadow. The haematological and biochemical profiles were normal except for mild erythrocytopenia. The patient successfully underwent TEVAR of the descending aorta. A postoperative oesophagogastroduodenoscopy revealed the extrinsic compression of the lower oesophagus with Rokitansky's diverticulum proximal to the compression area . A barium oesophagram showed an oesophageal obstruction with severely delayed barium flow . An oesophageal self-expandable covered stent was placed in position . After the oesophageal stenting, his dysphagia rapidly improved,  and he was able to tolerate a full diet and recover from the aspiration pneumonia. The postoperative period was uneventful. CT angiography 3 months after this hybrid stenting therapy revealed good anatomical position and no migration , and he remained well 1 year after the operation.
