In June 2008, a 72-year-old man underwent an EVAR using a bifurcated Anaconda stent-graft (Vascutek, a Terumo company, Inchinnan, Scotland) for a 90-mm infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). During EVAR surveillance, the aneurysm sac decreased to 65 mm at 3 years. However, during the fourth year, an ultrasound scan demonstrated sac growth to 90 mm and a type II endoleak. This was treated with coil and glue embolization, but subsequent imaging showed a persistent type II endoleak. A direct sac puncture and glue embolization was attempted twice (6 months apart), but the sac continued to expand.
