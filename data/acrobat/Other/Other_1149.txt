A previously healthy 7-year-old boy presented to an outside hospital with altered mental status and seizures. He had history of weight loss, intermittent blurry vision, polyuria, and polydipsia for 2 weeks. His initial blood pressure was 220/130 mmHg. Computed tomography scan of the brain was normal. His seizures were controlled with lorazepam. He was started on a calcium channel blocker, nicardipine drip, and transferred to Children's Hospital Los Angeles (CHLA) for further management and work-up of the hypertension. At CHLA, physical examination was significant for tachycardia (136 beats/min) and hypertension (166/ 96 mmHg). The patient was noted to have a waxing and waning mental status and a hyperdynamic precordium. He had a normal respiratory and abdominal examination. There was no evidence of virilization. An abdominal ultrasound revealed a mass at the superior pole of the left kidney, concerning for an adrenal mass. Serum electrolytes revealed marked hypokalemia (2.1 mEq/L) and normal sodium (138 mEq/L). TSH, T4, and cortisol levels were normal. Further tests of serum and urinary catecholamines and of the reninâ€“angiotensin aldosterone system (RAAS) were obtained to rule out pheochromocytoma as summarized in . These and all subsequent laboratory values were drawn while the patient was positioned supine. Initial values were drawn within 4 h of starting the nicardapine drip.
