A 48-year-old Sri Lankan Moorish woman from Colombo presented to our emergency treatment unit with bilateral sudden-onset painless loss of vision. There was no associated tearing, irritation, or red eyes. Six months previously she had noted bilateral, slowly growing breast lumps for which she has not taken medical advice, on cultural grounds. The lumps subsequently became ulcerated, with intense pain and discomfort . She also complained of painful non-healing ulcers in her palate over the previous 3 months, with no associated anogenital ulceration . Background constitutional symptoms had been present for 1 year, but the results of the rest of her systemic review were normal. After admission, she developed a dry cough and moderate hemoptysis without fever. She had no family or contact history of TB, and no family history of malignancies or autoimmune disorders. A general examination revealed that our patient was of average build with no lymphadenopathy. She did not consent to a genital examination. An examination of her respiratory system showed bilateral diffuse coarse crepitations. There was no dullness over her lung fields and no bronchial breathing was present. Her skin and nails appeared normal with no stigmata of chronic disease. Results from cardiovascular, rheumatological, and neurological examinations were normal.
