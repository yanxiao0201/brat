An eight-year-old male (weight 28 kg) was transferred to our facility for bridging to lung transplantation while supported by VV ECMO via a single-site bicaval dual-lumen (BCDL) catheter. Prior to transfer to our facility, an HIT antibody assay was obtained due to thrombocytopenia and clots within the ECMO circuit and found to be positive. Confirmation was obtained using 14C-serotonin release assay. The HIT antibody assay remained elevated upon arrival to our facility. Unfractionated heparin was replaced with bivalirudin for anticoagulation with a goal activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) of 60 to 80 seconds. After stopping unfractionated heparin, the platelet countevaluation, he was found to have significant allosensitization and subsequently required plasma exchange in addition to intravenous therapy with methylprednisolone, rituximab, bortezomib, and immunoglobulin infusion. For the first plasma exchange, the 1.5 volume exchange was targeted with a 50:50 mixture of fresh frozen plasma (FFP) and 25% albumin. Subsequent plasma exchanges utilized 100% FFP. The aPTT was monitored every 15 to 20 minutes during the plasma exchange, with variability of aPTT occurring with the mixed exchange  while the exchange with 100% FFP was more consistent . illustrates the bivalirudin infusion rate during both plasma exchanges with the boluses that were required. The patient tolerated both plasma exchanges well, with creatinine ranging from 0.20 to 0.32 (normal 0.20-0.70) mg/dL. The two exchanges were performed within 48 hours of each other. The circuit remained free of clots and there was no clinical concern for bleeding. Donor organs never became available, so he died after 92 days on VV ECMO, but his death was unrelated to plasma exchange.
