Three patients were referred to our institution for surgical management of left lower lobe stage I non-smallcell lung cancer discovered incidentally on aneurysm surveillance imaging or during work-up for shortness of breath . The first was a 71-year-old woman with a past history of aortic valve replacement and open repair of an ascending aortic aneurysm followed by endovascular repair of a descending thoracic aneurysm. The second patient was a 75-year-old woman with a history of type IV thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm for which open repair via a left thoracoabdominal incision had been performed 2 years earlier. Similarly, a 56-year-old man presented 6 months after open repair of a type IV thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm that developed in the setting of an endoleak complicating his previous endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm repair. Due to their extensive thoracic surgical history, we counseled each patient preoperatively that although VATS would be the initial approach, conversion to an open procedure was a real possibility. The surgeon placed each patient in the right lateral decubitus position and entered the left chest via 3 thoracic ports in addition to a 3-cm access incision in the 5th intercostal space. Extensive adhesions, particularly to the diaphragm and posterolateral chest wall along the aortic graft, necessitated careful dissection to safely isolate the inferior pulmonary vein, and identification of the fissure required complete decortication. Due to marginal pulmonary function in the setting of severe emphysema, the decision was made preoperatively to proceed with a
