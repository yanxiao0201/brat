We herein present the case of a 34-year-old man with a remote history of a gunshot wound in the right groin who presented to our hospital with right buttock and leg pain. A pelvic radiograph showed numerous dense objects on the right superimposed on a faint ring-calcified lesion . The pelvic radiograph findings were initially interpreted to be normal, with the exception of the presence of gunshot fragments. However, the patient's pain persisted and a computed tomography (CT) scan was obtained to exclude the possibility of intra-articular loose bodies. Consequently, a large post-traumatic pseudoaneurysm was detected on CT , and endovascular repair was subsequently performed.
