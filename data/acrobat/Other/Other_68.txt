A 42-year-old male patient had a 10-year-history of psoriasis vulgaris and scalp psoriasis. After complaining of pain in the sacroiliac joint and knee, axial psoriatic arthritis was diagnosed. The laboratory tests showed elevated infl ammatory markers, with negative antinuclear antibodies and rheumatoid factor. Methotrexate (15mg subcutaneously) plus narrowband UVB was introduced. However, given the decline in therapeutic effi cacy, we decided to change to immunobiological therapy with adalimumab. The patient received adalimumab 40 mg subcutaneously every two weeks plus topical calcipotriol, and showed good response to therapy. After 22 months of treatment, the patient complained of myalgia, arthralgia in the wrists and elbows, fever of 38 degrees and appearance of skin lesions. Dermatological examination revealed discrete purpuric papules on the ends of the fi ngers and periungual telangiectasias. There were no other systemic signs. Laboratory evaluation showed elevated ESR, positive ANA at a titer of 1: 640 with homogeneous pattern and positive anti-histone antibodies (Figures 1, 2 and 3). Histopathology of an erythematous-violaceous papule on the skin of the right hand dorsum showed a predominantly neutrophilic infl ammatory infi ltrate in the interstitium and in the wall of the superfi cial and deep capillaries. There was fi brinoid change in the wall of these capillaries and leukocytoclasia, consistent with leukocytoclastic vasculitis (Figures 4 and 5). Based on the clinical and histopathological fi ndings, we made the diagnosis of drug-induced subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus. Adalimumab was discontinued and cyclosporine (300 mg daily) was prescribed, with no improvement. After three months with no response, we introduced etarnecept (50 mg weekly), with gradual reduction of cyclosporine The patient had complete resolution of the symptoms, with no recurrence of psoriasis or lupus.
