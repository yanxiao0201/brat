A 70-year-old woman who had been previously treated for bipolar disorder and dementia was admitted to the intensive care unit of our hospital with severe dyspnea. Physical examination at admission revealed systemic cyanosis, jugular venous distention, and hypotension (90! 40 mm Hg). Arterial blood gas analysis (oxygen inhalation at 9 L! min via a face mask) disclosed hypoxia, hypocapnia reflecting tachypnea, and an extremely high alveolararterial oxygen tension difference ( pH: 7.411; PO2: 67.2 mmHg; PCO2: 34.0 mm Hg; HCO3-: 26.5 mmol! L; and calculated A-a DO2: 318.1 mmHg). Electrocardiography showed sinus rhythm without right ventricular hypertrophy, and radiography of the chest revealed cardiomegaly without pulmonary congestion. In addition, transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) revealed a significantly dilated right atrium and ventricle with a moderate amount of pericardial effusion, although no left ventricular dysfunction was observed . The tricuspid regurgitation pressure gradient (TRPG) was greater than of transthoracic echocardiorgraphy (TTE) on admission are shown in Figures 1 and 1. TTE after the patient's improvement is shown in .
Dilated right atrium and ventricle and a moderate amount of pericardial effusion without left ventricular dysfunction. The tricuspid regurgitation pressure gradient (TRPG) of 73 mm Hg indicated severe tricuspid regurgitation.
The interventricular septal flattening and paradoxical motion toward the left ventricle resulted in a D-shaped left ventricle on cross section.
After treatment with specific oral PAH agents, the enlarged right ventricle and ventricular motion both returned to normal. The D-shaped appearance of the left ventricle on cross section also disappeared.
