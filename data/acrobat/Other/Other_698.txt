A 65-yr-old male patient presented in outpatient department with complaints of weakness and bone pains. Patient was admitted in hospital for investigation. Peripheral smear examination showed rouleaux formation, mild microcytic hypochromic anemia and eosinophilia. A bone marrow aspiration was done. Bone marrow aspirate smears showed hypercellular cell trails . Myeloid to erythroid ratio was 4:1. Erythropoiesis was showing normoblastic maturation. Plasma cells; mature and immature, were about 50% of all the nucleated cells in the marrow. Many atypical, binucleated, trinucleated plasma cells were observed ( inset). Megakaryocytes were normal in number and morphology. X-ray of the bones showed multiple punched out lesion of skull and hip bone. The diagnosis given was plasma cell myeloma. Subsequently, the peripheral smear and bone marrow slides were discussed during one of the postgraduate teaching session where only one student reported the presence of microfilaria of W. bancrofti , apart from myeloma cells. The peripheral blood smear and bone aspirate smear slides were reviewed again, and it showed presence of microfilaria in the peripheral smear as well. Follow up of the case could not be done as the patient did not turn up even after repeated contacts.
