A 68-year-old man who had not been previously diagnosed with proteinuria or hematuria presented to his primary care physician complaining of a poor appetite two months prior to the current admission. A laboratory examination revealed anemia and renal impairment, and he was referred and subsequently admitted to our hospital for a further examination of these symptoms. At the time of admission, the patient's body temperature was 35.9, his pulse rate was 64 beats per minute and his blood pressure was 120/71 mmHg. He weighed 53.4 kg and had experienced a body weight loss of 5 kg within the preceding three months. No rashes or lymphadenopathy were observed, and no lung rales or heart murmurs were detected on chest auscultation. An examination of the abdomen was unremarkable, and there was no edema in either leg. A urinalysis revealed proteinuria with a protein level of Department of Nephrology, Kurashiki Central Hospital, Japan, Department of Haematology/Oncology, Kurashiki Central Hospital, Japan, Department of Anatomic Pathology, Kurashiki Central Hospital, Japan, Department of Molecular Pathology, Ehime University Graduate School of Medicine, Japan and Department of Internal Medicine, Shigei Medical Research Hospital, Japan Received for publication February 2, 2015; Accepted for publication April 6, 2015 Correspondence to Dr. Masaru Kinomura, kinomura@okayama-u.ac.jp 0.61 g/gCr, the absence of occult blood, with 1-4 red blood cells per high-power field, and five granular casts per each entire field. The urinary N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase (NAG) level was 24.5 IU/gCr and the urinary beta 2microgloburin level was 78,455 μg/gCr. A blood examination showed normochromic normocytic anemia, with a red cell count of 2.94 million/μL and a hemoglobin level of 10.0 g/dL. The laboratory findings showed renal dysfunction as well as hypercalcemia, with a blood urea nitrogen level of 58 mg/dL, a serum creatinine level of 4.19 mg/dL, an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of 12.1 mL/min/ 1.73 m 2 , a serum calcium level of 11.4 mg/dL, ionized calcium level of 2.88 mEq/L and a serum phosphate level of 4.7 mg/dL. The urinary calcium level was 0.12 g/gCr and the percentage of renal tubular reabsorption of phosphate was 40.4%. In addition, the serum parathyroid hormone (PTH) level was 21 pg/mL (normal range: 10-65), while the serum 1-25(OH)2 vitamin D3 level was decreased (8.2 pg/ mL; normal range: 20.0-60.0) and the plasma PTHrP level was increased (6.8 pmol/L; normal range: <1.1). Immunoelectrophoresis of the urine was positive for kappa-type Bence-Jones proteins. Furthermore, the concentration of the serum kappa-type free light chain (FLC) was increased at 2,180.0 mg/L, and the FLC ratio (kappa/ lambda) was 110.1. Bone marrow aspiration showed 34.9% plasma cells, and the patient was diagnosed with MM. Whole-body computed tomography and 18 F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography showed no apparent bone lesions. The size and shape of the kidneys did not suggest atrophy on abdominal ultrasonography or computed tomography.
