A 56-year-old man presented with a 4-day history of right-sided tongue deviation with numbness. This was accompanied by mild dysarthria, dysphagia and neck pain. There was no history of transient focal neurology. His only medical history was hip bursitis controlled by ibuprofen. A neurological examination upon admission revealed mild dysarthria and a wasted tongue with no fasciculation deviating to the right side . The remaining examination was unremarkable. Investigations showed a normocytic anaemia with haemoglobin of 97 g/dL. Urea was raised at 11.3 mmol/L with a creatinine of 279 Î¼mol/L and a mildly elevated calcium of 2.57 mmol/L. Total protein was high at 102 g/L with a normal albumin. CT head demonstrated an expansile bony lesion invading the occipital condyles and occipital bone on the right side with other bony skull lesions . A whole-spine MRI demonstrated extensive disease in the cervical and thoracic vertebra. Renal biopsy showed cast nephropathy with acute tubular changes. A bone marrow aspirate showed >50% plasma cells with some multinucleated cells and plasmablasts, diagnostic of MM. Treatment with bortezomib, thalidomide and dexamethasone was commenced, with a view to subsequent peripheral stem cell transplantation. Radiotherapy to the skull base was also given.
