A 38-year-old Caucasian man with rheumatoid arthritis and schizophrenia presented to the emergency department with 3 weeks of progressively worsening rash, malaise and fatigue. He had no prior dermatological diagnoses and was taking no medications. For the past 6 months, due to self-diagnosed gluten insensitivity, his diet consisted solely of rice, beans, corn and carrots, and water. Physical examination revealed corkscrew (arrow) and swan neck (arrowhead) hair deformities with associated petechiae in a predominantly perifollicular distribution, most prominent on the lower extremities ( , B). Aside from rheumatoid factor, all autoimmune serologies were negative. L-ascorbic acid level was found to be undetectable (<0.1 mg/dL, normal 0.46â€“ 1.49 mg/dL). He was treated with vitamin C supplementation and counselled to eat a balanced diet. His fatigue and malaise improved within 24 h, and follow-up examination 3 months later demonstrated complete resolution of his perifollicular petechiae .
