A 24-year-old male, ethnic Uzbek was referred to our clinic in November 2014. The patient described arthritis of the first left metatarsophalangeal, knee, talocrural, and elbow joints at the onset of the disease at the age of 18. Recurrent painful oral and genital ulcers joined a year later, and bilateral panuveitis was diagnosed at the age of 20. Definite diagnosis of BD was reached thereafter in accordance with the International Study Group for BD criteria , considering the presence of recurrent oral and genital ulcers, uveitis, skin lesions (pseudofolliculitis), and positive pathergy test. Positivity for HLA B51 and B27 was also detected. The patient initially received high-dose corticosteroid therapy (60 mg/day of oral prednisolone), which was successful and allowed to taper the dose. The therapy was discontinued by the patient without consulting physicians. BD symptoms relapsed within 1 year. In 2010, infliximab infusions were prescribed. The patient received 300 mg (3.5 mg/kg) infliximab on weeks 0, 2, 6, and then every 8 weeks over 3 years with dramatic improvements. The treatment was stopped in November 2013, and BD symptoms relapsed again 6 months later. Upon his admission to our clinic in November 2014, his complaints were painful oral aphthous ulcers, visual acuity decrement for the right eye, pain and swelling over the left talocrural joint, pain over the left hip joint, weight loss, and fatigue. Physical examination revealed multiple nodular erythema of the lower extremities, pseudofolliculitis on his back, and arthritis of the left talocrural joint. A referral to an ophthalmologist allowed to diagnose bilateral panuveitis, left optic neuritis with angiitis, and cataract of the right eye. The patient did not smoke and did not have other harmful habits. Laboratory tests: C-reactive protein (CRP) 216 mg/L (normal range 0–5 mg/L), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) 70 mm/h, white blood cell (WBC) count 12.3 thousands/µL (4–9 thousands/µL), platelet count 346 thousands/µL (150–390 thousands/µL), hemoglobin 101 g/L (130–160 g/L), hematocrit 29.7 % (35–50 %), fibrinogen 10.05 g/L (1.8–4.0 g/L), and D-dimer 2.11 µg/L (0–0.5 µg/L). Antiphospholipid antibodies, methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) gene mutations, and factor V Leiden mutation were all negative. Electrocardiography showed sinus bradycardia. Chest X-ray was unremarkable. Apical four-chamber view echocardiography revealed slight dilatation of both ventricles and left atrium and contrast mass in the left ventricle suggestive of intracardiac thrombosis . Left ventricular end-diastolic diameter was 61 mm (normal range 40–55 mm) and end-systolic diameter 38 mm (25–38 mm). Heart valves were normal. Vascular ultrasonography ruled out thrombosis in portal veins, venae cavae, and lower extremity veins. The treatment of the exacerbation of BD included oral methylprednisolone 16 mg/daily and azathioprine 150 mg/ daily. Additional intravenous pulses of methylprednisolone 500 mg/daily were administered on three consecutive days during 2 weeks (cumulative dose − 3 g methylprednisolone). Anticoagulation was not initiated due to the high likelihood of aberrant pulmonary aneurysms in the patient. All clinical features of BD disappeared after 2 weeks of the immunosuppressive treatment. Laboratory tests also normalized: CRP 1.2 mg/L, ESR 13 mm/h, WBC 8.1 thousands/µL, platelet count 197 thousands/µL, hemoglobin 122 g/L, hematocrit 36.2 %, fibrinogen 2.77 g/L, and D-dimer 0.5 µg/L. Transthoracic echocardiography, performed after 10 days of the initial echo examination (!), did not found any abnormality in the heart chambers and valves . No flares of BD were observed since then.
