We received a 39-year-old woman with a 4-month history of oral lesions, previously diagnosed as having angioedema without urticaria (at the age of 9) and AH ( A, B). She took captopril pro re nata ( " as required " ) sublingually for AH episodes and showed no signs of involvement of cutaneous or other mucosal surfaces. Investigations revealed slight blood eosinophilia (8%). Indirect immunofluorescence (IIF) on monkey esophagus revealed IgG  and IgG4 pemphigus-type antibodies (titre: >1/80 and 1/80, respectively). Direct immunofluorescence of oral mucosa showed IgG4 (+)  and C3 (++), but not IgA, IgM, IgG or IgG1, pemphigus deposits. Histopathology H+E staining did not allow for unequivocal evaluation due to a lack of oral epithelium in the specimen sent to the laboratory. Anti-desmoglein 3 (DSG3) IgG and IgG4 ( ,F) were detected in the serum using IIF on 6-substrate mosaic (monkey esophagus; primate salt-split skin; dots of tetrameric BP180-NC16A; DSG1/DSG3 â€“ extracellular and transmembrane domains; BP230 C-terminal domain expressed in HEK293 cells). 2 The ELISA demonstrated elevated serum IgG anti-DSG3, but not anti-DSG1, autoantibodies (>200 RU/ml and 1.514 RU/ml, respectively; manufacturer cut-off 20 RU/ml). IIF and ELISA kits were produced by the German company Euroimmun. Based on clinical, immunopathological and biochemical/molecular data, a diagnosis of an apparently captopril-induced, contact mucosal-dominant PV was established. At the hospital, the patient was advised to refrain from taking pemphigus-triggering drugs and to take the following orally: doxycycline 2x100mg/ day, niacinamide 1200mg/day and cetirizine dihydrochloride 2x10mg/day. She also received cyclosporine solution as a mouthwash (twice a day). The oral lesions initially became less burdensome.
