penetration depth, maintaining a safe distance from the pericardium. Interestingly, our cases had two things in common. The site of EBUS-TBNA was 4R (Lower paratracheal lymph node on the Right), close to the superior pericardial recess and these lymph nodes contained large necrotic lesions. Although no direct inoculation of the pericardium occurred from the needle, infection could develop with a simple tissue prick adjacent to the pericardium, especially in cases of necrotic tissue. Also, pericarditis can develop through the contiguous spread of infection from an intrathoracic focus or bacteremia. According to the guidelines for endoscopic ultrasound (EUS)guided sampling, prophylactic antibiotics are recommended for EUS-Fine needle aspiration (FNA) with cystic lesions . However, there is no definitive guideline or consensus for the use of prophylactic antibiotics before EBUS. Based on our cases, we recommend antibiotic prophylaxis for EBUS-TBNA with necrotic lesions located in the middle mediastinum, because of the possibility of serious complications such as acute pericarditis, or death. Similar to previous reports, our patient who died did not develop a fever despite the extent of infection. It was known that low-virulence S. viridans might lead to an insidious and widespread infection. Therefore, patients with symptoms or discomfort after EBUS-TBNA should be closely monitored for infectious complications. Also, if the symptoms do not improve after pericardiocentesis, doctors should not hesitate to perform surgical pericardiotomy for purulent pericarditis as guidelines recommend.
