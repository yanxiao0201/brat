A 28-year-old woman with ITP visited our hospital with the desire to have children. ITP had been already diagnosed by a prior history of bleeding and a low platelet count, and other possible causes of thrombocytopenia were excluded based on physical and bone marrow examinations. Recently, she had been hospitalized for severe thrombocytopenia. She had a platelet count of 3 × 10 9 /L and subcutaneous bleeding immediately following pregnancy at 6 weeks' gestation, despite maintaining the platelet count at 30–90 × 10 9 /L with 3–5 mg/day of prednisolone (PSL) before pregnancy. The patient's platelet count could not be maintained at higher than 30 × 10 9 /L, even with two treatments of IVIG (0.4 g/kg/ day for 5 days) and intravenous pulses of methylprednisolone (0.5 g/day for 4 days) followed by oral PSL (30 mg/day). Her attending physician decided to end her pregnancy with platelet transfusion for reasons of maternal safety at 10 weeks' gestation. To ensure subsequent pregnancies, we controlled the platelet count at prepregnancy at a set point of higher than 100 × 10 9 /L with 17.5 mg/day of PSL. The patient then became pregnant for the second time. Initial laboratory studies at the first visit after pregnancy showed a white blood cell count of 4.83 × 10 9 /L, hemoglobin of 140 g/L, mild thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 70 × 10 9 /L, and high levels of fibrinogen degradation products (FDP) (4.3 μg/mL; normal range, <4) and D-dimer (2.9 μg/mL; normal range, <1). The results of other blood coagulation tests were as follows: prothrombin time/international normalized ratio of 0.96, activated partial thromboplastin time of 23.4 s, fibrinogen level of 2.56 g/L, antithrombin III activity of 92.1%, protein C activity of 89% (normal range, 64–146%), protein C antigen level of 81% (normal range, 70–150%), protein S activity of 52% (normal range, 60–150%), protein S antigen level of 75% (normal range, 65–135%), and platelet factor 4 (PF-4) level of 8 ng/mL (normal range, <20 ng/mL). Immunological analysis showed a weakly positive antinuclear antibody titer of 1:80, antiDNA antibody was 2.0 IU/mL (normal range, <6 IU/ mL), anti-U1-RNP antibody was 121 U/mL (normal range, <10 IU/mL), CH50 was 45.1 U/mL, C3 was 84 mg/dL, C4 was 24 mg/dL, and platelet-associated IgG (PA-IgG) was 59 ng/10 7 cells (normal range, <46 ng/10 7 cells). Lupus anticoagulant was 1.03 (normal range, <1.3) and antiphospholipid antibodies, including anti-cardiolipin IgG antibodies, anti-β 2-glycoprotein I antibodies, and anti-prothrombin antibodies, were not detected. Immediately following pregnancy, an elevation in FDP and D-dimer levels, with a decrease in platelets was observed . Thrombocytopenia and a fibrinolytic state became significant with the date of gestation and the level of PF-4 was increased (127 ng/mL) at 9 weeks' gestation. This suggested that a rapid decrease in platelet count after pregnancy might be associated with platelet activation and thrombogenesis, as well as with antibody-mediated destruction of platelets. Our patient had no clinical evidence of arterial and venous thrombosis. No significant aberrations in platelet aggregation tests (collagen, 67%; ristocetin, 78%; epinephrine, 68%; adenosine diphosphate, 70%), von Willebrand factor antigen level (362%; normal range, 20–155%), von Willebrand factor activity (388%; normal range, 60–170%), ADAM13 activity (158%; normal range, 70–120%), and factor VIII activity (200%; normal range, 62–145%) were observed. Anticoagulation therapy was performed by continuous unfractionated heparin injection (10,000 U/day), and the dose of PSL was increased to 30 mg/day at 10 weeks' gestation. We used additional IVIG (0.4 g/kg/ day for 5 days), albeit early in the course of the disease, and also expected to minimize the dose of corticosteroids in the first trimester. The platelet count recovered from 40 × 10 9 /L to 90 × 10 9 /L for 3 weeks. The laboratory findings in the second trimester were as follows: PA-IgG was 32 ng/10 7 cells, platelet antibody-secreting B cells for GPIIb/IIIa antigen by ELISPOT assay was 2.3 × 10 6 cells/ mL (normal range, <2.0 × 10 6 cells/mL), the reticuloplatelet ratio was 3.7% (normal range, 0.7–3.0%), thrombopoietin was 0.44 pg/mL (normal range, <300 pg/mL), and PF-4 was 13 ng/mL. The dose of PSL was tapered below 15 mg daily and heparin treatment was continued throughoutpregnancy. The platelet count was maintained above 100 × 10 9 /L , and she delivered a 2500-g boy vaginally at 37 weeks' gestation without any hemorrhage. Infant Apgar scores were 9 and 10 at 1 and 5 min, respectively. Neonatal thrombocytopenia secondary to maternal ITP did not occur.
