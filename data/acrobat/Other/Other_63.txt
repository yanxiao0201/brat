A 20-month-old boy was referred to our department for evaluation of congenital cutaneous abnormalities. On examination, black-brown pigmentation patches (nevus of Ota) affected bilateral skin of the forehead, upper eyelid, alae of the nose, zygomatic region, temporal region, cheek and anterior auricle, i.e. the innervation area of both the second and third branches of the trigeminal nerve and terminal infraorbital nerve (Figures 1A and B). Opthalmic examination revealed blue spots on the cornea, conjunctiva, and blue sclera . Light blue spots were also seen on the nasal mucosa. We observed demarcated greyish-blue hyperpigmentation with clear-cut margins (Mongolian spot) affecting his trunk, back, buttocks, arms and right shoulder (Figures 1A and 1D). Erythematous patches (nevus fl ammeus) were noted on the regio cervicalis anterior, left shoulder and upper limb . Isolated CMTC, consistent with irregular, pale macules and patches (nevus anemicus) were present on his left leg calf, and nevus anemicus might be most obvious on the rear side of the right ankle . The child was born full-term through vaginal delivery, weighing 3000g. Both the pregnancy and labor were uneventful. He did not suffer from chronic diseases. His family and personal history were unremarkable. At the time of writing, no alterations in neuropsychomotor development were observed, and the extremities were symmetrical, without atrophy or hypertrophy signs in the soft tissues. The blood and urine routine, biochemistry, electrocardiography and electroencephalogram were all within normal limits.
