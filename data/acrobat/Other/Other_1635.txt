A 34-year-old Japanese woman was admitted to Aichi Medical University Hospital because of dyspnea and systemic edema. She had had atopic dermatitis since 10 years of age. She was treated with second-generation oral contraceptives for 10 years before admission for uterine fibroids and menstrual complains. Her father died from lung cancer with scleroderma. She had no history of smoking. She did not receive anti-hypertensive drugs because of no detection of hypertension. Three weeks prior to admission, she had a sore throat and a high fever, up to 38°C. Two weeks prior to admission, she visited a local doctor due to the persistence of these symptoms, and she was found to have proteinuria, but a normal blood pressure. Clarithromycin relieved her fever; however, she began to have a cough and hoarseness at night and in the early morning. One week before admission,she experienced dyspnea and edema in both legs, and her complaints were not improved by the use of furosemide. Therefore, she was referred to our hospital because of extremely severe hypertension (200/140 mmHg). On this admission, her mental status was normal, height was 153 cm, and weight was 60 kg, an increase of 10 kg over one week. Her body temperature was 36.4°C, pulse was 115 beats/min and regular, respiratory rate was 20 breaths/min, and blood pressure was 250/160 mmHg. A physical examination revealed redness in the left eye, coarse crackles in both lower lung fields, and bilateral lower extremity edema. A funduscopic examination demonstrated flame-shaped hemorrhages or soft exudates with papilloedema . Laboratory studies indicated 4 + proteinuria (1.27 g/day), 1 + urine occult blood with 2-3 RBC/HPF, a white blood cell count of 10,500, red blood cell count of 4.82×10 12 /L, hemoglobin of 14.5 g/L, hematocrit of 43.5%, platelet count of 453×10 9 /L, albumin of 3.2 g/dL, blood urea nitrogen of 14.5 mg/dL, serum creatinine of 0.97 mg/dL, and total cholesterol of 192 mg/dL. Na was 137 mEq/L, K was 4.3 mEq/L, Cl was 101 mEq/L, AST was 88 U/L, and ALT was 128 U/L. Lactate dehydrogenase was 546 IU/L, CK was 337 IU/L, and CRP was 2.60 mg/dL. PT-INR was 1.42, APTT was 24.2 s, fibrinogen was 545 mg/dL, FDPDD was 20.78 μg/mL (normal range: below 1.0), and antithrombin III (ATIII) was 80% (normal range: 80-130). Rheumatoid factor, anti-nuclear antibody, hepatitis B antigen, hepatitis C virus antibody, and other autoantibodies were all negative. A few days later, the following results became available: plasma renin activity was 5.3 ng/mL/h (normal range in the bed rest position 0.3-2.9), plasma aldosterone concentration was 168 pg/mL (normal range: 30-160), cortisol was 34.5 μg/dL (normal range: 2.7-15.5), ACTH was 33.6 pg/mL (normal range: 7.2-63.3), adrenalin was 441 pg/mL (normal range: below 100), noradrenalin was 1,449 pg/mL (normal range: 100-450), and dopamine was 20 pg/ mL (normal range: below 20). Protein C activity was 91% (normal range: 65-135), protein S activity was 155% (normal range: 70-160), and factor VIII activity was 264% (normal range: 60-130). A blood culture examination revealed no bacteremia. A plain chest X-ray demonstrated an enlarged cardiac silhouette, with a cardiothoracic ratio of 56% . Electrocardiography (ECG) showed inverted T waves in V5 . Echocardiography revealed two 18 mm masses in the left ventricle with a small amount of pericardial effusion with normal thickness of the ventricular wall (posterior wall thickness: 9.5 mm). The ejection fraction was 0.55 ( , B). After making a diagnosis of hypertensive crisis, we administered 12.5 mg of captopril, which decreased her blood pressure from 250/160 mmHg to 154/97 mmHg three hours after administration. Thereafter, a long-acting angiotensinconverting enzyme inhibitor (ACE-I) and an angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) were prescribed to maintain the blood pressure. Human atrial natriuretic peptide (hANP) and furosemide were started to improve the cardiac function and systemic edema. Regarding the left ventricular masses, we initially suspected cardiac myxoma. On the fourth hospital day, the patient suddenly exhibited disorientation and memory disturbance. Enhanced abdominal CT demonstrated renal infarcts and occlusion of the mesenteric arteries . MRI revealed multiple cerebral small emboli ( , C). Echocardiography revealed the disappearance of the left ventricular masses ( , D), which suggested left ventricular thrombi. We initiated heparin, warfarin, and antiplatelet therapy. A hormonal examination demonstrated no abnormal findings with regards to the cortisol, ACTH, adrenalin, noradrenalin, and dopamine levels. The patient was discharged with complete recovery from systemic embolism on the 27th day after admission. A plain chest X-ray demonstrated a normal cardiac size with a cardiothoracic ratio of 48% . An ECG showed no abnormal findings . Echocardiography revealed no pericardial effusions and an ejection fraction of 0.72 without ventricular wall thickness. There were no significant increases in the levels of antibodies, such as enteric cytopathic human orphan (ECHO) virus and Coxsackievirus in paired serum samples taken one week apart. Urinary abnormality disappeared at discharge. The patient's condition has been goodfor 7 years following the ACE-I and beta blocker treatment.
