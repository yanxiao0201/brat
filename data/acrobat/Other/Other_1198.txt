A 69-year-old woman had central metamorphopsia for more than 20 years. Her medical history was significant for β-thalassemia trait and hypertension. She was hypermetropic with no history of ocular trauma or surgery. Her family history was unremarkable. In 2009, her best-corrected visual acuity was 20/60 OD and 20/40 OS. Color fundus photography  showed bilateral loss of normal foveal transparency but no visible telangiectatic changes. In the right eye, an ectatic retinal venule was noted to change its angle by 90° on the surface of the retina, but stereoscopic information indicates there were no typical " dilated and blunted retinal venules that extend at right angles into the depth of the parafoveolar retina " 3 as described by Gass and Blodi. Fundus fluorescein angiography (FFA) confirmed absence of classic temporal juxtafoveal leakage . Blue-wavelength autofluorescence showed bilateral loss of luteal pigment inferotemporal to the fovea characteristic of MacTel . Cirrus high-definition optical coherence tomographic imaging (Carl Zeiss Meditec) in 2009 showed bilateral inner retinal cavitation with no disruption of the outer retinal layers . Five years later, her BCVA was 20/80 OD and 20/60 OS. Optical coherence tomography showed development of outer retinal cavitation with bilateral subfoveal disruption of the ellipsoid layer and external limiting membrane . There was still no visible telangiectasia or temporal juxtafoveal dye leakage on FFA (eFigures 1-4 in the Supplement).
