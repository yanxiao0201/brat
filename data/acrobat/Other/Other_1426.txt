A 57-year-old nonsmoking man with diabetes and treated hypertension (blood pressure, 120/75 mm Hg) and no prior GI disorders or bleeding has a calculated 10-year ASCVD risk of 12.0% (calculated using the 2013 American College of Cardiology and the American Heart Association pooled cohorts risk equations). 7 He is receptive to the concept of long-term aspirin use. The 2016 USPSTF guidelines and the 2016 American Diabetes Association recommendations advise use of low-dose aspirin for a patient with his clinical history. 8 The net benefit of aspirin for this patient would be moderate to substantial for preventing ASCVD (specifically MI) and also for preventing colorectal cancer. The patient, with an estimated 0.12% absolute annual risk of GI bleeding, is not at increased risk of bleeding (10-year risk, 1.2%). With low-dose aspirin, the estimated bleeding risk increases to 0.19% per year (10-year risk, 1.9%;
Aspirin for primary prevention should be highly individualized based on a benefit/risk ratio assessment for each patient and a clinician-patient discussion regarding potential benefits, potential harms, and patient preferences.Related article at jamainternal medicine.com number needed to harm , 144). 6,9 Conversely, the estimated 10-year number needed to treat (NNT) to prevent 1 ASCVD event is 56 (assuming 15% RR reduction of ASCVD with low-dose aspirin, which would reduce this patient's 10-year ASCVD risk from 12.0% to 10.2%). Even without accounting for the potential 20% to 40% relative reduction in colorectal cancer risk with 10 years of daily aspirin use, the ASCVD benefit alone (10-year NNT, 56) outweighs the GI bleeding risk (10-year NNH, 144). Furthermore, randomized clinical trials of aspirin therapy indicate that the RR reduction for preventing MI for men 50 years and older may be even greater than 15%. 1 A 68-year-old nondiabetic nonsmoking woman with treated hypertension (blood pressure, 155/82 mm Hg) and dyslipidemia (lowdensity lipoprotein cholesterol, 70 mg/dL while taking a statin) has a history of peptic ulcer disease. Despite a high 10-year ASCVD risk of 13.2%, the USPSTF would give this patient a grade C recommendation for aspirin use (individualize therapy). However, the guidelines would also consider her at high risk for GI bleeding (older age and prior peptic ulcer disease could increase her GI bleeding risk as much as 6-fold if an uncomplicated ulcer and as much as 10-fold if the ulcer was complicated by bleeding). 10 Because the estimated risk of ASCVD for this patient is high (13.2%) and randomized clinical trial evidence suggests a benefit of aspirin for reducing both MI and stroke in women aged 65 years and older, 1 this patient would be a candidate for low-dose aspirin (10year NNH of 133 compared with an NNT of 50) if she did not have a history of peptic ulcer disease and her blood pressure were well controlled (systolic <150 mm Hg). The patient's peptic ulcer history and higher bleeding risk increase the complexity of decision making. If her prior ulcer was complicated by bleeding, her GI bleeding risk without aspirin could be as high as 7.8% over 10 years, 6,9 and aspirin may further increase this risk to more than 12% (10-year NNH of 23 compared with an NNT of 50). Even if she had a remote history of uncomplicated ulcer, her NNT would still be higher than her NNH. Thus, this patient would be a poor candidate for initiation of aspirin therapy. If the patient and clinician chose to proceed with cautious use of low-dose aspirin, concomitant GI prophylaxis should be seriously considered. 1
