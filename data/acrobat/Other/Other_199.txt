Patient 1 A 15-year-old girl was found to have proteinuria for the first time during routine urinary screening at our hospital. At birth, she was extremely premature, defined as gestational age <28 weeks (24 weeks) and of extremely low birth weight, defined as <1,000 g (618 g), but her birth weight was appropriate for gestational age. She was the first-born of triplets. The second baby was born dead, and the surviving third baby had cerebral palsy. Patient 1 had several perinatal problems associated with prematurity, including respiratory complications; patent ductus arteriosus, which was treated with indomethacin; and retinopathy of prematurity. There was no evidence of irreversible kidney injury during the neonatal period. She was followed up developmentally at our hospital until the age of 4 years and by a nearby doctor until the age of 13 years. Proteinuria was not detected during routine health examinations at school. At the age of 15 years, she started taking carbamazepine for epilepsy at our hospital. She had mild mental retardation, but no physical disabilities. At the age of 17 years, a physical examination revealed a height of 146.8 cm (−2.1 SD), a weight of 36.4 kg (−2.3 SD), a body mass index (BMI) of 16.9 kg/m 2 , blood pressure of 110/ 68 mmHg, and no edema. Laboratory examination showed an elevated serum creatinine level of 0.92 mg/dL, with cystatin C level of 0.98 mg/L, a blood urea nitrogen level of 12.2 mg/dL, and a uric acid level of 4.7 mg/dL. Her 24-h creatinine clearance was 58–101 mL/min/1.73 m 2. Other laboratory parameters of CKD were within normal ranges without acidosis; her hemoglobin level was 16.9 g/dL, her serum calcium level was 9.6 mg/dL, her phosphate level was 3.5 mg/dL, and her intact parathyroid hormone level was 44 pg/mL. Nephrotic syndrome was not observed, with her albumin level 4.7 g/dL and her total cholesterol level 231 mg/dL. Her serum complement levels were within normal ranges. She was negative for anti-nuclear antibody, hepatitis B surface antigen, and hepatitis C antibody. Urinalysis revealed a 2+ reaction for protein and 24-h urinary protein 1.3 g, but she was negative for heme and glucose. Renal ultrasonography revealed small kidneys, the lengths of her right and left kidneys measuring 7.2 cm and 8.2 cm respectively. A renal biopsy was performed to determine the cause of persistent proteinuria. Light microscopy showed 12 glomeruli, none of which was globally sclerotic . To evaluate glomerular size, the maximum diameters of four glomeruli cut at or near the hilus were measured. Their mean was 224 μm (range 193 to 255 μm), larger than the mean diameter of 168 μm (range 138 to 186 μm) for 21 normal controls . All glomeruli showed evidence of glomerulomegaly, and several showed hyaline deposits in the vascular pole and hypertrophy of the juxtaglomerular apparatus ( , c). The renal tubules and vasculature appeared normal. Immunofluorescence showed that the mesangial matrix was slightly positive for IgM, but negative for IgG and IgA. Electron microscopy showed one glomerulus with perihilar segmental sclerosis . These pathological findings strongly suggested glomerular hypertension . Following treatment with lisinopril (10 mg/day), her proteinuria disappeared; after 5 years of treatment, no proteinuria was detected, but her renal function was mildly aggravated. Her height was 147.2 cm (−2.1 SD), her body weight 37.8 kg (−2.2 SD), and her BMI 17.4 kg/m 2. Her serum creatinine level had increased to 1.12 mg/dL and her cystatin C level to 1.15 mg/L. Other laboratory parameters of CKD remained within the normal range without acidosis; her hemoglobin level was 13.5 g/dL, her serum calcium level was 9.3 mg/ dL, and her phosphate level was 3.5 mg/dL. Hypertension was not observed. A 14-year-old boy was found to have proteinuria and hypertension for the first time during a health examination at school. His birth had been complicated by extreme prematurity (gestational age 25 weeks) and extremely LBW (842 g), although his birth weight was appropriate for gestational age. Renal failure did not occur during the neonatal period. He was born at another hospital and developmental follow-up was stopped in childhood. He had mild mental retardation without physical disabilities. Physical examination showed a height of 155.3 cm (−1.0SD), a weight of 52.0 kg (−0.1SD), a BMI of 21.5 kg/m 2 , blood pressure of 132/78 mmHg, and no edema. Laboratory examination showed that his serum creatinine level was 0.78 mg/dL, his cystatin C level was 0.88 mg/L, his blood urea nitrogen level was 17.7 mg/dL, his uric acid level was 7.8 mg/dL, his serum albumin level was 4.9 g/dL, and his total cholesterol level was 218 mg/dL. His 24-h creatinine clearance was 114–123 mL/min/1.73 m 2. Other laboratory parameters of CKD were within normal ranges without acidosis; his hemoglobin level was 16.9 g/dL, his serum calcium level was 10.2 mg/dL, his phosphate level was 3.4 mg/dL, and his intact parathyroid hormone level was 19 pg/mL. His serum complement levels were within normal ranges. He was negative for anti-nuclear antibody, hepatitis B surface antigen, and hepatitis C antibody. Urinalysis revealed a 2+ reaction for protein and 24-h urinary protein of 0.8 g, but it was negative for heme and glucose. He was diagnosed with stage 1 hypertension , observed during the day and at night by 24-h monitoring. His blood catecholamine, plasma renin, and thyroid hormone levels were normal. Stenosis of the renal artery was not detected by enhanced computed tomography. Renal scintigraphy showed no scarring. Renal ultrasonography revealed small kidneys, the right and left kidneys measuring 8.1 cm and 7.9 cm in length, respectively. A renal biopsy was performed to determine the cause of persistent proteinuria. Light microscopy showed nine glomeruli, none of which was globally sclerotic. The mean maximum diameter of the four glomeruli was 199 μm (range 160 to 258 μm). All glomeruli showed evidence of glomerulomegaly , with some having hyaline deposits at their vascular poles. Segmental sclerosis was not detected, nor were there any abnormalities in the renal tubules and vasculature. The mesangial matrix was slightly positive for IgM, but negative for IgG and IgA. These pathological findings were suggestive of glomerular hypertension . Following treatment with 10 mg/day lisinopril, his proteinuria immediately disappeared and his hypertension improved, to a blood pressure of 110–120/60–70 mmHg. After treatment for 6 years, his proteinuria and renal function were not aggravated. His height was 157.2 cm (−2.6 SD), his body weight was 57.8 kg (−0.7 SD), and his BMI was 23.4 kg/ m 2. His serum creatinine level was 0.86 mg/dL and his cystatin C level 0.88 mg/L. Other laboratory parameters of CKD were within normal ranges without acidosis; his hemoglobin level was 17.1 g/dL, his serum calcium level was 10.5 mg/dL, and his phosphate level was 4.4 mg/dL.
