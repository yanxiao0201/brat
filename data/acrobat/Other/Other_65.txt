A 47-year-old woman presented to our clinic with a 6-year history of asymptomatic erythematous papules over the trunk and extremities. The lesions fi rst appeared on her right leg and healed spontaneously, leaving an atrophic residual scar. Similar skin lesions had been appearing gradually and spreading across the whole body surface in the subsequent 5 years. At the age of 46, the patient experienced a 2-hour episode of visual fi eld constriction in the right eye. Two months later, her right calf was anesthetic and she noticed a painless vision decrease and permanent visual fi eld constriction in her right eye, which prompted her to seek advice.
Cutaneous examination revealed multiple, round and linear, atrophic porcelain white papules of 5-10mm in diameter over the trunk and extremities, with some showing an erythematous telangiectatic peripheral halo . Neurologic examination found hypesthesia and paresis in the right calf. Cranial nerves examination showed that the abducent nerve and optic nerve were impaired, resulting in weakened movement on the right side, visual deterioration, and visual fi eld constriction of the right eye . Tendon refl exes were normal and Babinski signs were negative. Histopathology revealed central epidermal atrophy, papillary dermal sclerosis, and perivascular lymphocytic inflammatory cell infiltrates, in addition to vascular thrombosis . Analytical assessments were normal, including blood cell count, urinalysis, serum chemistry analysis, immunoglobulin profile, myocardial enzymes, CRP, ESR, RF and all plasma autoantibodies. But the fecal occult blood test was positive. Visual evoked potential
