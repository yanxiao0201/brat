A 72-year-old woman presented to the Plastic Surgery Department at Faith Regional Health Services (Norfolk, Nebraska) in October 2011 with a large pannus after claiming to have lost 322 lb of body weight by diet alone over a 5-year period (weight decreased from 550 lb to 228 lb; body mass index decreased from 78 to 32). Her weight had been stable for the past 2 years. She had a medical history of diabetes mellitus, atrial fibrillation, tubal ligation surgery, depression, and oxycodone allergy. Her medications at the time of presentation included warfarin (suspended preoperatively), atenolol, sitagliptin, metformin, and sertraline. Results of blood tests performed 2 weeks preoperatively were unremarkable (hemoglobin, 14.6 g/dL; sodium, 141 mmol/L; potassium, 4.2 mmol/L; albumin, 3.7 g/dL; prealbumin, 17 mg/dL), and her electrocardiogram showed no evidence of ischemia. An uneventful panniculectomy was performed by the senior author (T.H.) under a general anesthetic. Operating time was 3.5 hours, with an estimated blood loss of 250 mL. Intravenous fluids (3 L) were administered intraoperatively. The resected pannus weighed 16 lb.
