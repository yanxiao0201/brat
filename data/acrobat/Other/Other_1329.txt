of cerebral perfusion. Several methods have been described in the literature that could be helpful to assess the indication for further cerebral revascularization in elective patients . However, the risk of damaging the collateral network during surgery has to be considered. This case demonstrates the significance of aortic complications, anastomotic aneurysm formation and graft occlusion after surgical repair in Takayasu's disease and the effectiveness of collateral brain perfusion in selected patients. Conflict of interest: none declared. REFERENCES Perera AH, Mason JC, Wolfe JH. Takayasu arteritis: criteria for surgical intervention should not be ignored. Int J Vasc Med 2013;2013:618910.

Left axillary bypass was reconnected to the Sienaâ„¢ graft, venous coronary bypass grafts were arranged as a Y and anastomosed to the aorto-axillary bypass. Both grafts were patent. Brain perfusion and perfusion of the right arm were still achieved via collaterals.
