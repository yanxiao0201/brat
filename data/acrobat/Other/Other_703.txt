We recruited a volunteer with type 2 diabetes (female; 58 years of age; HbA1c 8.3%) for a diabetic foot risk screening. A medical history and a diabetic foot simplified clinical assessment protocol were performed. We also acquired plantar thermal images  through a high-resolution infrared camera (FLIR Systems, Model SC2000; 320Ã—240 pixels). The skin temperatures of hallux, first, third and fifth metatarsal spots on both feet were calculated. The patient under study did not have a record of foot wounds or ulcers nor of history of claudication or pain at rest. Sensitive changes were detected through the monofilament test in the left foot (hallux, first and third metatarsals), and decreased peripheral arterial pulses in the same foot ( posterior tibial and dorsalis pedis arteries).
