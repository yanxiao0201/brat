A 79-year-old woman with an eventless cardiovascular medical history presented at the emergency department with acute-onset chest pain radiating to the back, accompanied by nausea, vomiting, and profuse sweating. The patient was hemodynamically stable, with a blood pressure of 130/70 mm Hg in both arms and heart rate of 60 beats per minute; the ECG showed no signs of cardiac ischemia, and cardiac biomarkers were not elevated. A computed tomography scan of the chest and abdomen showed a Stanford type B dissection of the aorta (Movies I and II in the online-only Data Supplement), which extended to the suprarenal aorta, not involving the renal arteries. The celiac trunk and superior mesenteric artery originated from the false lumen, without signs of mesenteric ischemia. The patient was treated medically with intravenous labetalol, targeted at a heart rate <60 beats per minute (with systolic blood pressure <120 mm Hg), and analgesia. A second computed tomography scan 3 days after admission showed a stable dissection with progressive thrombosis of the false lumen. In the following days, the patient's heart rate and blood pressure remained within the target range with IV labetalol, pain was adequately treated with opioids, and the labetalol dose was lowered gradually. At day 6 after admission, the patient suddenly developed excruciating thoracic and abdominal pain, became hemodynamically unstable shortly thereafter, and died because of rupture of the dissection.
