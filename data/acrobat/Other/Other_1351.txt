Clinical history A 33-year-old female patient with a 2-year history of hypertension was referred to the University Hospital Dresden because of incidental findings of three abdominal masses by magnetic resonance imaging carried out for evaluation of back pain. Biochemical testing indicated elevated plasma normetanephrine of 272 pg/mL (upper cutoff, 112 pg/mL) and a normal metanephrine level. Urinary normetanephrine was also elevated to 843 g/24 h (upper cutoff, 379 g/24 h). After clonidine, plasma normetanephrine could only be suppressed to 216 pg/mL from 281 pg/mL. Computed tomography confirmed a right adrenal tumor of 2.2 cm, a retroperitoneal polycystic tumor of 3.0 4.6 cm (paraganglioma 1), and a para-aortic mass of 2.6 cm (PGL2). Computed tomography of the thorax and abdomen excluded pulmonary or additional abdominal tumors. Meta-iodobenzylguanidine scintigraphy revealed both retroperitoneal masses, but not the adrenal mass. Histologically, the retroperitoneal tumors were both diagnosed as PGLs, and the adrenal tumor as an adrenocortical adenoma. On yearly follow-up, the patient has remained disease-free. The patient was investigated under an approved protocol with signed informed consent.
