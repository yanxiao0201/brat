A 62-year-old woman presented with acute onset of vertigo. Her past medical history included uncontrolled hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and smoking (40 pack-years). Her neurological examination was normal and she was ultimately diagnosed with benign paroxysmal positional vertigo. However, non-contrast CT of the head showed a hyperdensity at the basilar apex without hemorrhage. Subsequent CT angiography followed by digital subtraction angiography showed an 11 mm×7 mm basilar tip aneurysm. The aneurysm had a wide neck from which the right posterior cerebral artery (PCA) originated. Additionally, the left PCA and left superior cerebellar artery (SCA) arose from opposite surfaces of the fundus of the aneurysm . We decided that treatment of this aneurysm was indicated given its size, location, and the patient's poorly controlled risk factors for aneurysm rupture. Any safe treatment required preservation of the right PCA and the left SCA. Although the left PCA also arose from the aneurysm fundus, loss of its origin would likely be tolerated due to retrograde filling from the posterior communicating artery (PCoA). We believed that both clipping and endovascular therapies carried similar deficiencies— namely, loss of the left SCA or incomplete aneurysm treatment. We considered a flow diverting stent, but this was not a viable option because a thalamoperforator injury was a risk and there would still be persistent flow and filling of the aneurysm from the PCoA. The microsurgical open technique included subtotal clipping in order to preserve patency of the SCA, otherwise an attempt for a complete clipping could be done with a superficial temporal artery– SCA bypass. We therefore chose an endovascular construct that took advantage of the left PCoA, providing a route to the PCA.
