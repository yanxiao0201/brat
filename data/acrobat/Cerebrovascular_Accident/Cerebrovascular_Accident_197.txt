A 73-year-old female patient was coma mental state when she arrived in the emergency room of a university hospital. The Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score was 5/15 (eye opening 1, best verbal response 1 and best motor response 3). She was diagnosed with spontaneous ICH in the right frontotemporal lobe. Brain CT at the onset of ICH showed a right-to-left midline shift with TTH due to the large haematoma in the right frontotemporal lobes . Brain MRI taken at 1 month after onset showed that the haematoma had resolved and no significant injury was observed in the brainstem, except for both cerebral peduncles . However, the patient still exhibited impaired consciousness with intact arousal as 8/15 (eye opening 4, best verbal response 1, and best motor response 3) on the GCS score. Five age-matched control participants (four male; mean age: 69.5 years) were recruited for the control group. All participants provided signed informed consent and our institutional review board approved the study protocol.
