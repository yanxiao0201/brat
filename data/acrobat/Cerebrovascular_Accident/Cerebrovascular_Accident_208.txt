Patient A 62-year-old male was hospitalized in 2009 with a spontaneous hematoma in the left hemisphere. The patient had no known neurological diseases. At the time of admission, the patient had arterial hypertensive crisis (190/100 mmHg), hemiparesis and hypesthesia on the right side of the body. Babinski sign was positive on the right side. CT scan examination report indicated hemorrhage in the left basal ganglia region 2.0 Ã— 2.5 cm in size. We were limited by information in radiologists' report as no CT scans were available to us for a more detailed inspection. After 4 days of treatment, the patient was discharged from the Stroke Unit with slight disability (modified Rankin scale score: 2). The motor function of the affected (dominant) hand was sufficient to perform coarse manual tasks not requiring fine control or high force. The patient had neither pain nor paresthesia in the affected limb; however, it was noticed that the patient mislocalized the touch on the skin of the affected hand and reported unusual sensation in the fingers, describing it like wearing a glove.
