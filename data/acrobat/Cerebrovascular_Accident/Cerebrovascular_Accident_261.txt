An 84-year old woman underwent right CAS for treatment of a symptomatic 90% stenosis of the right internal carotid. Her medical history included arterial hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, diabetes and two episodes of transient ischemic attacks. At admission a right carotid bruit was present, the neurological examination was normal, blood pressure level was 130/ 80 mmHg and a plain brain CT scan was unremarkable.After pre-treatment with heparin and clopidogrel, the CAS procedure was performed using a protection device and positioning a self-expanding stent across the stenotic plaque. The CAS procedure was complicated by tortuous arterial anatomic features, therefore a considerable amount (400 mL; 8.33 mL/Kg) of iomeprol, a monomeric nonionic contrast medium, was administered. The patient's blood pressure was controlled during the procedure, and there was no evidence of hypertension. Undesired events did not occur during the procedure. The patient did not present any neurological symptoms postoperatively. At the control angiogram the stent was correctly positioned. A routine post-procedure brain CT scan showed a diffuse gyral and sulcal hyperdensity (<64 HU) in the right temporal-occipital and frontal lobes . Due to the patient's intact neurological status, CT findings were interpreted as related to gyral contrast enhancement and extravasation of contrast material into the subarachnoid spaces and no therapeutic decisions were made. A 24-hour follow-up brain CT demonstrated a complete resolution of the gyral and subarachnoid hyperdensity .
