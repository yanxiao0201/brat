A 41-year-old woman with asthma presented with progressive blurred vision and significant loss of left eye peripheral vision, which had acutely worsened that morning. She had a 10-month history of headache, red eyes, and chemosis, previously managed with corticosteroids with recent addition of topical latanoprost. On examination, visual acuity was 20/60 in both eyes, with left relative afferent pupil defect. There was corkscrew dilation of conjunctival vessels with ciliary flush and hyperemia, chemosis, proptosis, and pulsatility on tonometry—left greater than right. Gonioscopy showed an open angle without blood in Schlemm's canal. IOP on the right was 20 mm Hg; left, 49 mm Hg . Visual fields demonstrated arcuate defects, left greater than right. Optical coherence tomography demonstrated bilateral thinning of the optic nerve retinal nerve fiber layer, left greater than right. Brimonidine, dorzolamide, and acetazolamide were administered to reduce IOP acutely; β-blockers were not given because of asthma.
