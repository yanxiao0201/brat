An 83-year-old man with a history of arterial hypertension and dyslipidemia, presented to a neurologist with a tremor of the right hand. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain was performed, which did not show major abnormalities ( and C). A routine carotid ultrasound revealed an occluded right internal carotid artery (ICA) and high-grade stenosis (>75%) of the left ICA. An uncomplicated carotid endarterectomy (CEA) of the left ICA was performed, and the patient was discharged 2 days later. Eight days post CEA, he was admitted at our hospital with sudden onset of aphasia and confusion. On neurological examination, severe aphasia and a mild right-sided hemiparesis were documented; in addition, his blood pressure was elevated (213/75 mm Hg). Computed tomography (CT) of the brain was normal and a CT angiography showed a patent left ICA. He subsequently developed fever (38.6Â°C) for which a lumbar puncture was performed. Analysis of the cerebrospinal fluid was unremarkable. Shortly after admission, he experienced an epileptic seizure and treatment with levetiracetam was initiated. The diagnosis of a cerebral hyperperfusion syndrome (CHS) was considered for which the blood pressure was closely monitored. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain ( and D) revealed extensive fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) hyperintense white matter changes in the left hemisphere, with no signal alteration on diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), confirming the diagnosis of CHS. The white matter changes were new because magnetic resonance imaging of the brain a few months before admission had not revealed these changes (Figure A and C). The symptoms resolved completely during a period of several days.
