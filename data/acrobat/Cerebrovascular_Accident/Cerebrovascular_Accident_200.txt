A 70-year-old Japanese man living in Shinshiro, Aichi Prefecture, which is believed to be a non-endemic area of hereditary transthyretin amyloidosis in Japan, was hospitalized in August 2014 with confusion and complex partial seizures with secondary generalization. During the months before admission, he had had several episodes of loss of consciousness, aphasia, and right hemiparesis lasting several days. T1-weighted MRI after contrast agent administration revealed diffuse leptomeningeal enhancement along Sylvian fissures  and over surfaces of the brainstem, cerebellum, and spinal cord. Susceptibility-weighted imaging showed diffuse, low-signal-intensity symmetrical rims of the Sylvian and other fissures in the cortex, which indicated the presence of cortical superficial siderosis (cSS) caused by repeated subarachnoid hemorrhages . Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis revealed xanthochromia and an increased protein level, to 101 mg/dL without pleocytosis. A surgical biopsy of the leptomeninges was performed through the right cerebral hemisphere. We found white cotton-like materials in the subarachnoid space . Vascular walls seemed fragile, and conventional procedures easily induced repeated small blood leaks. Congo red staining revealed severe CAA and leptomenigeal amyloid deposits ( and E). All amyloid deposits reacted with an anti-TTR antibody .
Patient 2 was an older brother of patient 1. In November 2014, his neurological findings included visual impairment, muscle weakness, hypesthesia, hyporeflexia, and ataxic gait. He did not realize that his recent memory was disturbed. MRI findings were quite similar to those of patient 1: diffuse leptomeningeal enhancement and cSS . CSF analysis revealed xanthochromia and a protein level that had increased to 98 mg/dL without pleocytosis.
