An eight-year-old girl who was hit by a truck was brought by the emergency medical service (EMS) to the Emergency Department of the Alberta Children's Hospital, Calgary, Canada. The Glasgow-Coma-Scale (GCS) was 5/15 when EMS team attended the scene. She suffered polytrauma with TBI resulting in intubation and was ventilated for the first two days. The computed tomography (CT) scan showed a depressed right parietal bone fracture with subarachnoid hemorrhage requiring neurosurgical intervention. Her GCS improved dramatically up to 15/15 on the sixth day. Eleven days later, she experienced cognitive impairment rendering a MRI scan necessary. This was done on a 1.5 T Siemens scanner which revealed the depressed fracture and subarachnoid hemorrhage with counter coup injury. DWI (Ech-Planar Imaging-Spin Echo (EPI-SE): Repetition Time (TR) 3100, Echo Time (TE) 76, slice thickness 5, b value ¼ 0, 500 and 1000) and ADC maps showed restricted diffusion involving the corpus callosum, peri-atrial white matter, and right ). The ADC values ranged from 0.24–0.34 Â 10 À3 mm 2 /s. On followup MRI scan 13 days later, there was complete resolution of the described abnormal DWI/ADC-restriction areas . Only a residual subtle area of gliosis in the splenium of corpus callosum was seen on T2weighted images.
