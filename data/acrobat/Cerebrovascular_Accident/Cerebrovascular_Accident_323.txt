Prior to any treatment, 60% of all patients had a poor outcome (mRS score > 1), whereas after treatment, the proportion dropped to 32%. Patient functional outcomes improved with most modalities of treatment, including SE (preoperative poor mRS score 67%, postoperative poor mRS score 6%), RE (preoperative 54%, postoperative 26%), and embolization (preoperative 61.4%, postoperative 28.6%). No improvement was observed, however, in the observation group (preoperative 30.8%, postoperative 30.8%) or the SR group (preoperative 100%, postoperative 100%). The association of treatment modality with followup mRS score was found to be significant (p = 0.039). Only 1 patient in the SE group experienced adverse outcome, with 94.1% of patients achieving an optimal outcome at last follow-up. The proportions of good outcomes in other modalities were as follows: RE (74.0%), SR (0.0%), embolization (71.4%) and observation (69.2%). As shown in , patients presenting with seizures had a significantly higher risk of poor functional outcome (63.6%, p = 0.027). This was primarily due to uncontrolled seizures at follow-up. Patients with mild presenting symptoms, such as headaches, were more likely to obtain a favorable outcome following appropriate management (p = 0.025). We did not establish a significant association between ruptured presentation and follow-up outcome (p = 0.141). None of the angiographic features aside from frontal lobe location (p < 0.001) were significantly associated with poor functional outcomes. This is consistent with our clinical experience that most patients with a frontal lobe injury resulted in a constellation of symptoms including personality, mental, cognitive, and even speech disorders. In addition, frontal lobe injury was associated with a higher likelihood of having seizures at follow-up. All ofthese factors contributed to the limitation of the patients' ability to return to normal school or work, rendering a significantly worse mRS score at last follow-up. Larger AVM size demonstrated a trend toward significance (p = 0.081) in predicting poor functional outcomes.
