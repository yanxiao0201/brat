evidence that, within the left temporal network sustaining the processing of semantically unique items, the posterior temporal regions could be involved in the retrieval of proper name codes. Our group of six poststroke patients with damage in the posterior language areas showed a significantly lower performance in the famous face-naming task compared to controls. However, in order to achieve our research goal, only patients with a performance of 2 SDs at or below the mean of the control group were included in the study. Several explanations could account for the fact that only three out of six chronic patients met our severe inclusion criteria for persisting famous face anomia. One of the hypotheses is that there was a ceiling effect on the inclusion/exclusion criteria and that if harder tests of face naming had been provided, perhaps all persons with the appropriate lesions would have performed worse than controls. Another possible explanation is that the three excluded patients may have manifested spontaneous or therapy-induced reorganization and recovery of language functions, as described by numerous previous studiesaforementioned patient studies. The present study seems to provide some evidence for the role of the mid-posterior temporal language areas in retrieving proper names as well. Although this region has been also implicated in the retrieval of common object names , we have shown that damage in this zone may result in persistent selective proper name retrieval difficulties in the context of excellent language recovery. This may be because the linking of proper names with their reference is notoriously more fragile than that of common nouns with their reference and may require a larger amount of metabolic resources . In summary, the present case reports provide some clinical support to recent functional neuroimaging findings in healthy subjects regarding proper name processing.
