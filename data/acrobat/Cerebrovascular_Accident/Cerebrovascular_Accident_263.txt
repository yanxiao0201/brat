The patient was in his sixties and had a history of percutaneous coronary intervention for angina pectoris, sigmoid colon resection and partial bladder resection for infectious colon-bladder fistula, and gastrectomy for gastric cancer. The patient also had a history of hyperthyroidism, chronic renal dysfunction (stage IV), liver dysfunction, diabetes, and anemia. The patient was admitted to the hospital because of loss of consciousness (Glasgow Coma Scale E4V1M4).Toshiba Medical Systems, Otawara, Japan), and the second phase scan is performed 10 s after the initial scan. Other scanning parameters were 120 kVp, 300 mA, 0.5 s/rotation and 0.5 mm thickness for both of scans. On the source image of the second phase scan , minor extravasation was detected in the right Sylvian fissure, similarly to the so-called ''spot sign'' in intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). We reconstructed thick-slab maximum intensity projection (MIP) for both scans, and multiple tiny enhanced spots were additionally found in the interhemispheric fissure . Aneurysm was not found on CTA and percutaneous transarterial angiography. Plain CT on the next day  revealed an enlarged hematoma in both the right Sylvian and interhemispheric fissures. Neither surgical operation nor intravascular therapy was initiated, and the neurofunctional prognosis was poor.
