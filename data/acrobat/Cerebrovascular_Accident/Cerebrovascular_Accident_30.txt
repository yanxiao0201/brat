A 41-year-old female presented with an aSAH and the angiogram revealed a large right MCA aneurysm and a smaller ACoA aneurysm . There was symmetrical subarachnoid blood distribution on the CT head scan and the widenecked configurations of the aneurysms made them anatomically unsuitable for straightforward endovascular coiling. The patient underwent neurosurgical clipping to secure both the aneurysms with the postoperative angiogram confirming complete obliteration of both the lesions .
A 47-year-old female presented with a WFNS grade-I aSAH. Subsequent angiogram demonstrated a distal pericallosal aneurysm  unsuitable for endovascular treatment. She underwent delayed clipping of the aneurysm 2 weeks post ictus, and made an uneventful postoperative recovery.
A 39-year-old female presented with a WFNS grade-II aSAH. She underwent coiling of the ruptured complex wide-necked ACoA aneurysm ( and B). Unfortunately, she rebled within a week post ictus and repeat angiography showed an unsecured aneurysmal 'bleb' . This complex aneurysm was made more challenging for neurosurgical clipping as the coils were in situ but subsequent post-operative imaging showed that the aneurysm was completely occluded by clipping . Her further management was complicated by the development of DIND and hydrocephalus. The latter was eventually treated with the insertion of a ventriculoperitoneal shunt.
