Jr. Intraluminal Support 2.5 Ã‚ 20 mm, Microvention, Tustin, CA, USA) in the M1/M2 segment, an angiography showed the correct stent placement. During removal of the microcathether, one of the flared ends of the stent had become snagged by the catheter pulling the stent backwards. The stent remained misplaced in the distal internal carotid artery, with its distal end pointing towards the aneurysmal neck ( (a)). In order to avoid further complications, the decision was made to stop the procedure and to refer the patient to neurosurgery. The subsequent open surgery had to be postponed, because of the double antiplatelet medication. A pre-surgical re-evaluation by a CT-angiography ( (b)) showed that the distal portion of the stent had migrated into the aneurysmal neck. During surgery, temporary clipping of M1 had to be avoided, due to the risk of a potential vessel laceration. Since the stent had ended up exactly at the clip occlusion level, a perforation of the aneurysm or insufficient clip closure was feared ( (c)). Therefore, a curved clip was used in a plane parallel to the optimum plane, at an appropriate distance from the end of the stent. We applied a second curved clip to one of the fragile blebs on the neck; and wrapped the remaining part of unsecured aneurysm ( (d)). The postoperative clinical course of the patient was without complications.
