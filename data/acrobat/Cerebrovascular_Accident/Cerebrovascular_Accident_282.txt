The 4 patients analyzed in this study had samples from resections performed at different periods following SRS. These samples were also obtained from 4 different anatomical locations: right thalamus/midbrain region, right pons, left mesial temporal lobe, and left pons.
History and Examination A 23-year-old female presented with acute-onset facial and oral numbness accompanied by mild frontal headache. Computed tomography studies of her brain demonstrated a 2 × 2–cm acute right thalamic hemorrhage that extended into the midbrain. Magnetic resonance imaging findings were compatible with a hemorrhagic CM. Given the lesion location and after discussing different options, observation was elected. The patient presented 6 months later with diplopia and left paresis, associated with further hemorrhage on MRI. She was discharged after stabilization and returned 2 months later for SRS.
History and Examination A 31-year-old male presented with 2 pontine hemorrhages during an 18-month period. The bleeds resulted in a progressive left paresis, right abducens paresis, and diffuse left sensory loss involving the face, arm, and leg. Magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated a hemorrhagic lesion in the right aspect of the pons .
History and Examination A 16-year-old epileptic female underwent partial resection of a left mesial temporal CM . Nine years later, when she was 25 years old, she presented with progressive right-sided weakness and uncontrolled partial seizures.
History and Examination A 51-year-old female presented with a 1-week history of facial numbness, dizziness, and blurred vision. A CT scan demonstrated a left pontine hemorrhage from a CM. Repeat MRI indicated further hemorrhage.
