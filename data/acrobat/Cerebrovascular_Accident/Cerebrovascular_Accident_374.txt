One of the major difficulties was to find unpublished appropriate datasets in which the rupture site is known. One of the authors (S.S.) was able to provide 2 cases: an unruptured aneurysm with MRA examination every 6 months during 5 years and a ruptured one with a documented site of rupture. They were chosen on the basis of similar geometric characteristics of the MCA segments. The 2 intracranial aneurysms that were part of this rupture challenge were both located at the left M1 segment. On-line summarizes the characteristics of both cases, which were not provided to participating CFD groups. Clinical Presentation of Case 1. A 77-year-old female patient underwent a medical checkup of the brain, and MR angiography revealed an unruptured aneurysm (approximately 10 mm) at the bifurcation of the left middle cerebral artery. Thereafter, the patient was followed up by MR angiography at 6-month intervals. Gradual growth of the aneurysm was observed during a 5-year follow-up; its form changed from spheric to irregular shape. Coil embolization was performed, considering the risk of rupture. Clinical Presentation of Case 2. The chief symptom of the case 2 patient was sudden headache. CT examination determined the diagnosis of an SAH (Hunt and Kosnik grade II/World Federation of Neurosurgical Societies grade I). During the neck clipping surgery, the aneurysm was completely exposed except for the ruptured site, which was covered with a thick fibrin cap. The fibrin cap was removed gradually with much caution, but accidentally, intraoperative rupture occurred.
