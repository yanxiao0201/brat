A 64-year-old man had suffered from RA since 1996 and had undergone right total knee arthroplasty in 2003. He had been taking antirheumatic drugs, such as bucillamine and MTX, but they were discontinued due to adverse events (nephritic syndrome and interstitial pneumonia, respectively). His disease could not be controlled with low dose Department of Rheumatology, National Hospital Organization Sagamihara National Hospital, Japan, Department of Laboratory Medicine, National Hospital Organization Sagamihara National Hospital, Japan, Department of Allergology and Respiratory Medicine, National Hospital Organization Sagamihara National Hospital, Japan, Department of Pathology, National Hospital Organization Sagamihara National Hospital, Japan and Department of Rheumatology, Clinical Research Center for Allergy and Rheumatology, National Hospital Organization Sagamihara National Hospital, Japan Received for publication April 15, 2014; Accepted for publication Correspondence to Dr. Yoshiyuki Arinuma, arinuma@yahoo.co.jp prednisolone (PSL) treatment alone; hence, etanercept (ETN) (50 mg/week) was started in April 2009. ETN administration led to remission but had to be discontinued due to the occurrence of urticarial rashes. Next, adalimumab (ADA) (40 mg/2 weeks) was tried, but it was also discontinued due to skin lesions. We then stopped targeting TNF-I and started TCZ treatment in June 2009. A low dose of cyclosporin (CyA) (50 mg/day) was also administered for complicated rheumatoid neutrophilic dermatitis after the first administration of TCZ. The patient's RA and skin lesion disease activity became well controlled with PSL (6 mg/ day), CyA (50 mg/day) and TCZ (8 mg/kg) every 4 weeks, and the patient's Disease Activity Score in 28 joints (DAS28-ESR) (15) and the Clinical Disease Activity Index (CDAI) (16) were 1.79 (remission) and 3.22 (low disease activity), respectively. The patient had no family history of rheumatic disease. He had been smoking 20 cigarettes a day since he was 20 years old. He and his family did not use a recirculating bathing system. The patient had felt general fatigue beginning the evening of late in July, 2011 and dyspnea the following morning. After two days, he was admitted to our hospital's emergency section for progressive dyspnea and severe appetite loss. On admission, his body temperature was 36.8 and blood pressure was 70/40 mmHg with a pulse rate of 102 beats per minute. His blood oxygen saturation using pulse oximetry was 90% in an oxygen flow of 10 L/min via a mask. His Glasgow Coma Scale was 14; eye opening 3, verbal response 5, and motor response 6. A physical examination revealed mild coarse crackles in the right chest and slight fine crackles in both the left and right sides. The laboratory testing results were as follows: red blood cell count 462×10 4 /mm 3 , hematocrit 40.6%, hemoglobin 14.6 g/dL, white blood cell count 9,070/mm 3 (90% neutrophils, 4% lymphocytes, and 1% eosinophils) and platelet count 8.8× 10 4 /mm 3. The arterial blood gas analysis (BGA) was: pH 7.452, PaO2 65.4 Torr, PaCO2 27.6 Torr, base excess-3.3 mmol/L and hydrogen carbonate ion 19.0 mmol/L in an oxygen flow of 10 L/min via a mask. The results of blood chemistry and serological tests showed an elevation of lactic acid dehydrogenase at 322 IU/mL, blood urea nitrogen 26.9 mg/dL, creatinine 1.57 mg/dL, C-reactive protein (CRP) 14.54 mg/dL and brain natriuretic peptide 34.4 pg/mL; however, his aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, γ-glutamyl transpeptidase and creatine phosphokinase levels were within the normal ranges. The patient's serum sodium, potassium and chloride levels were 135 mEq/L, 3.9 mEq/L and 104 mEq/L, respectively. The results of coagulation tests indicated a prothrombin (PT) time of 12.5 seconds, PT-international normalized ratio (PT-INR) 1.09, fibrinogen 403 mg/dL and D-dimer 5.8 μg/mL. His serum sialylated carbohydrate antigen KL-6, pulmonary surfactant protein D and beta-D-glucan were all within the normal range, but the procalcitonin (PCT) level was slightly elevated at 1.04 ng/mL and the neutrophil CD64 expression, accepted as a marker of infection (17), was strongly upregulated at 35,749 molecules/cell (normal cut-off level is 2,000). A chest X-ray showed consolidation in the lower lung field on the right and infiltrative shadow lower on the left.were significant emphysematous changes in the lungs.
