An 82-year-old woman with a medical history of type 2 diabetes and dyslipidemia who was not receiving medication, was urgently admitted to our institution because of a fever and disturbance of consciousness. Her vital signs on presentation were as follows: a body temperature of 38.2°C, a blood pressure of 153/70 mmHg, a pulse rate of 118 beats/min, a respiratory rate of 30 breaths/min, and a SpO2 at 98% (room air). Furthermore, a physical examination demonstrated a low Glasgow Coma Scale (E3 V2 M5), normal pupil size and pupil light reflex, and stiff neck. Laboratory data were as follows: a white blood cell count of, 21,300/μL (neutrophils, 86.4%; lymphocytes, 6.1%); a hemoglobin level of 15.9 g/dL, a platelet count of 315×103/ μL, a blood urea nitrogen level of 40.8 mg/dL, a creatinine level of 1.05 mg/dL, an aspartate aminotransferase of 69 IU/ L, an alanine aminotransferase level of 53 IU/L, a creatine kinase level of 2,559 IU/L, a glucose level of 374 mg/dL, a HbA1c level of 11.4%, and a C-reactive protein level of 31.58 mg/dL. A non-contrast cranial CT revealed no significant findings. The cerebral spinal fluid showed an increased white blood cell count of 2,824/mm 3 (polymorphonuclear cells, 75%; lymphocytes, 25%), increased protein levels of 605 mg/dL, decreased glucose levels of 125 mg/dL (cerebral spinal fluid glucose/blood glucose was nearly equal to 0.3), and an adenosine deaminase level of 25.2 IU/L. Gram staining of the cerebrospinal fluid revealed no organisms. As the initial presentation and investigations suggested bacterial meningitis, we administered ceftriaxone, vancomycin, ampicillin, and acyclovir. On day 5, we performed cranial MRI because she did not fully recover, in addition, we checked for a brain abscess, edema, and stroke. MRI revealed a brain edema and hydrocephalus. MRA showed no significant change . L. monocytogenes was detected in two blood cultures and a spinal fluid culture, demonstrating sensitivity to ampicillin and gentamicin. Therefore, the patient was switched to ampicillin plus gentamicin in order to achieve a synergistic action. Follow-up examinations of the cerebral spinal fluid on day 5 and day 15 showed improved pleocytosis (WBC, 6,572/mm 3 ; polymorphonuclear cells, 30%; mononuclear cells, 66%; WBC, 569/mm 3 ; polymorphonuclear cells, 94%; and mononuclear cells, 6%; respectively), and decreased protein levels (3,540 mg/dL and 2,470 mg/dL, respectively); in addition, spinal fluid cultures showed no growth. After initiating the antibacterial therapy, her symptoms displayed a gradual improvement. On day 15, she fell into a coma and developed generalized seizure. Non-contrast CT revealed a low density area in the right middle cerebral artery and posterior cerebral artery territory . Diffusion-weighted MRI showed a high signal intensity in the vascular territory of the right middle cerebral artery and right anterior cerebral artery, suggesting an acute multiple cerebral infarction  Moreover, MRA revealed multiple severe stenoses . The patient was treated with edaravone, ozagrel sodium, fosphenytoin sodium hydrate, and glycerol for 2 weeks. No further seizures occurred after therapy. On day 26, the cerebral infarction was no longer visible on the cranial CT due to the so-called fogging effect. After a 21-day course of intravenous ampicillin and gentamicin, the patient was discharged to extended care hospital.
