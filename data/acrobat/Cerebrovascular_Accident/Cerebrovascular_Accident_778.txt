An 80-year-old man was found unconscious. His medical history was notable for hypertension, dyslipidemia, recurrent syncope, diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, and depression. He neither smoked nor used alcohol. On examination, his blood pressure was 123/50 mmHg, pulse 55 beats per minute, and temperature 99.2Â°F. He was unresponsive with a fixed and dilated 7-mm left pupil and 3-mm right pupil, which had a sluggish response to light. The oculocephalic reflex was absent. The corneal and gag reflexes were intact. There was no facial asymmetry. No purposeful movements were noted. There was no withdrawal to severe nail-bed pressure. Babinski reflexes were present bilaterally. Computed tomography of the head showed no acute intracranial hemorrhage or mass lesion. The electroencephalogram showed no evidence of epileptiform activity. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain with and without contrast demonstrated acute ischemia in the midbrain involving both medial thalami (Figures 1 and 2). Magnetic resonance angiography showed no major vessel occlusion. A 2-dimensional echocardiogram revealed no vegetations or cardiac thrombi. Seven days after admission, the patient was still deeply comatose, with no improvement in his status. On the eighth day he was made comfortable and artificial ventilation was withdrawn. The patient died the next day. What is your diagnosis?
