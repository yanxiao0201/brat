Case 2 A 29-year-old woman diagnosed with MMD and GD presented with weakness of the left arm and leg. Right frontoparietal infarction was detected . Her fT 4, fT 3 , TSH, and TRAb were markedly elevated ( , day −20 of admission). Aspirin 100 mg/day and thiamazole 60 mg/day were given to control thyrotoxicosis prior to surgery. One month later, the patient was admitted with dysarthria and weakness of right leg, and a new cerebral infarct in the left frontal lobe . Then, a thyroid storm (fT 4 3.91 ng/ml, fT 3 10.09 pg/ml) occurred with thyrotoxic symptoms of fever, tachycardia, and hypertension. Early surgical revascularization was indicated, but thyrotoxicosis was considered a high risk for surgery. Intensive thyroid hormone therapy was initiated, and hormonal remission was achieved after approximately 70 days . Left STA-MCA bypass was conducted. As serious hyperperfusion in left MCA territory was observed shortly after surgery , barbiturate coma therapy was administered for 3 days. No additional ischemic and hemorrhagic complications occurred postoperatively ( , c). The mRS score was 4 on admission and 2 at 3 months after surgery.
A 29-year-old woman diagnosed with MMD and GD was admitted with left hemiplegia and cerebral infarction in right corona radiata . Severe thyrotoxicosis was observed at
). Thiamazole and potassium iodide were initiated to control thyrotoxicosis prior to surgery, achieving hormonal remission after approximately 60 days . Right STA-MCA bypass was performed 195 days after starting thyroid hormone therapy. After surgery, mild elevation of thyroid hormones with fever (38 °C) and transient tachycardia were observed, but no cerebral ischemic and hemorrhagic complications. The mRS score was 3 on admission and 2 at 3 months after surgery. One year later, the patient underwent contralateral revascularization surgery under normal thyroid condition with no complications.
