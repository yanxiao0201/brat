standard deviations of the two groups and FP's performance). Results show that FP's recognition performance differed significantly from the C group's (p = .03) but not the BDP group's (p = 0.46) performance. The same pattern of results emerged when the number of parts correctly positioned was compared: also in this case, FP scored lower than the C group (p = .03) but not the BDP group (p = .44). Instead, FP's performance differed significantly from that of both C (p = .00) and BDP (p = .026) groups for number of LRI. In summary, the patient's performance was significantly different from the C group's performance on all indices considered, but differed significantly from the BDP group's performance only in the number of LRI errors, because in the latter group LRI errors were infrequent. Note that a perusal of individual patients' performances shows that no patients in the BDP group performed the test by locating parts only on the left half of the board.
