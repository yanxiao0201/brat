A 55-year-old woman with a history of horizontal gaze paralysis and scoliosis  since childhood was admitted to our hospital with a history of acute left hemiparesis. Computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed left putaminal hemorrhage and brain stem hypoplasia (Figures 1B and 2). She is the first child of healthy parents who are second cousins, and her brother developed scoliosis in childhood. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) was performed to evaluate the corticospinal pathways. DTI tractography confirmed the presence of uncrossed corticospinal tracts .
