This study was approved by our Institutional Review Board and was stringently conducted in accordance with the ethical principles of the "Declaration of Helsinki". Patient biopsy was performed for diagnostic purposes only after we received written informed consent with permission to study patient-derived iPSCs. Note that 10 control subjects were also used in this study. A partial family pedigree for this patient is shown . In this family, there was no clinical history of any neuromuscular disease. He had no growth and mental retardation until firstly presenting epileptic symptoms at age 10 years. At age 11 years, he developed weight loss, activity loss, easy fatigue, cognitive impairment, and acute heart failure. Radiographic and ultracardiographic images revealed hypertrophic cardiomyopathy at interventricular septum and left ventricular wall . Markedly increased serum lactate level (114.7 mg/dL; 3.0-17.0 mg/dL as normal), serum pyruvate level (3.86 mg/dL; 0.30â€“0.94 mg/dL as normal), and lactate/ pyruvate ratio (29.7) were detected. At age 13 years, he developed headache, vomiting, visual disturbance, convulsion, and myoclonic status with unconsciousness. Brain MRI revealed multifocal hyper-intensity lesions at basal ganglia, cortex, and subcortical white matter of both cerebrum and cerebellum. A representative lesion showed decreased N-acetylaspartate level and increased lactate level . On this occasion, no significant abnormalities in serum lactate level (18.9 mg/dL), serum pyruvate level (0.99 mg/dL), or lactate/pyruvate ratio (19.0) were detected; however, cerebrospinal fluid lactate level (41.5 mg/dL), cerebrospinal fluid pyruvate level (1.40 mg/dL), and lactate/pyruvate ratio (29.6) were clearly high. Skeletal muscle histopathology revealed diffuse cytochrome c oxidase (COX) deficiency (less than 5 % population of COX-positive fibers) ; however, no other typical pathological abnormalities such as ragged-red-fibers or strongly succinate dehydrogenase (SDH)-reactive blood vessels were observed. We diagnosed this patient as MELAS and started oral administration of l-arginine, dichloroacetate, and sodium pyruvate. He relapsed with stroke-like episodes twice in 4 years. At age 14 years, he developed multiple organ involvement including acute pancreatitis, gastrointestinal malabsorption, renal tubular disturbance, and endocrine glucose intolerance. At age 15 years, he developed quadriparesis. Now, he keeps stable condition without serious trouble.
