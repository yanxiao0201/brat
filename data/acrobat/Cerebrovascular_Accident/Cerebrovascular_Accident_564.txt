The MRI in our patient revealed multiple hyperintense foci on diffusionweighted imaging sequences and corresponding hypointensities on apparent diffusion coefficient sequences, consistent with acute stroke . Results of the cerebrospinal fluid sample analysis were normal. Results of the laboratory workup for tuberculosis, sarcoidosis, and syphilis were negative. The patient received a 3-day course of intravenous methylprednisolone sodium succinate (Solu-Medrol); soon after therapy was transitioned to oral prednisone, he developed new symptoms and was found to have new cerebral infarcts. Oral cyclophosphamide was added, and he continued this regimen for 7 months before the prednisone dose was tapered gradually. Five months after treatment initiation, the patient's visual acuity was 20/20 OD and 20/25 OS, with no recurrence of the disease. Most patients with APMPPE can expect an excellent overall prognosis. However, physicians of patients who demonstrate any neurologic signs or symptoms should consider prompt neuroimaging because delayed treatment of APMPPE-associated cerebral vasculitis can result in substantial morbidity or death.
