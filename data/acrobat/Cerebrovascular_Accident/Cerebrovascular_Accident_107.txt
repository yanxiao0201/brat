A 7-year-old Afro-Caribbean girl was found unresponsive in bed by her parents. On admission, she had a Glasgow Coma Score of 3, with a right fixed and dilated pupil, and with no history of recent trauma. After intubation and ventilation, a CT scan showed the presence of a large right parietal extradural hematoma, with significant midline shift, and a smaller left parietal EDH . She was known to suffer from sickle-cell disease and suffered 3â€“4 crises a year. Her regular medication included penicillin V, folic acid, and zinc supplements. She had recently been discharged from the hospital with a recurrent episode of acute crisis (causing headaches) the day before she was found unresponsive. Blood tests on admission showed a hemoglobin level 8.4 g/dl, hematocrit 32 %, white blood cell (WBC) count 22,000/mm 3 , platelets of 216,000/mm 3 with normal electrolytes and liver function.
