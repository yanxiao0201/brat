A 43-year-old female was admitted to the hospital with a sudden onset of imperative headache, nausea and vomiting. Emergent computed tomography (CT) illustrated a subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH) and intraventricular haematocele (IVH) in the fourth and lateral ventricles. The subsequent cerebral digital subtraction angiography (DSA) revealed an abnormal anastomosis arising from the left internal carotid artery (ICA) at the C2 level and taking a typical dorsal course cephalad to the transverse process of Y.

In addition, a hypoplastic right vertebral artery (RVA) and an aplastic left vertebral artery (LVA) were also discovered . With well-developed collateral circulation, the patient was asymptomatic before this emergency. Moreover, the aneurysm of the left PICA was also discovered and considered to be responsible for the intracranial haemorrhage ( , c), and then an interventional embolism was conducted. Computed tomography angiography (CTA) after discharge demonstrated previous anomalies 2 months later ( , b, e).
