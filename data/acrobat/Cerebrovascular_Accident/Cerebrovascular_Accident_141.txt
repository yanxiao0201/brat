A 54-year-old woman ( , case no. 4) with a ruptured 4 mm bifurcation aneurysm (pericallosal/callosomarginal) was selected for urgent EM-guided surgery based on CT angiography. Preoperative CT of the head showed a subarachnoid hemorrhage in the frontal interhemispheric fissure without intracerebral or intraventricular hematoma. Clinical examination revealed a somnolent patient without further neurological deficits corresponding to Hunt and Hess III. The aneurysm could be visualized clearly in the preoperative 3D-CT angiography . After referencing the patient in supine position with the head fixed in the Mayfield clamp first, an external ventricular drainage on the right side was inserted via Kocher's point using the EM-navigation stylet without CSF release . Only after the angle for the optimized trajectory was confirmed by the EM navigation, the Mayfield clamp was fixed to the table. Thereafter, a tailored craniotomy and the optimal trajectory to the aneurysm were planned on the navigation screen using the tip extension view . The frontal sinus was left intact avoiding unnecessary possible complications and sparing operative time. Choosing a straightforward trajectory helped to avoid damage to the surrounding tissue and the bridging veins on the way to the aneurysm in this narrow anatomical corridor.
shows a good correlation between the intraoperative localization of the aneurysm with the CT angiography data set. There was good control of the parent vessel. After clipping of the aneurysm, ICG angiography was performed to confirm occlusion of the aneurysm and patency of the parent vessel distal and proximal to the clipped aneurysm. Postoperative CT control 6 h after clipping showed no infarction and postoperative transfemoral DSA reconfirmed complete occlusion of the aneurysm.
