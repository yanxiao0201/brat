A 10-year-old girl referred to our department to investigate severe headache, which had no previous history of motor weakness, sensory disturbance, seizure and involuntary movement, and only a history of severe headache several times from childhood. Magnetic resonance image (MRI) and magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) were performed by a local doctor, and moyamoya disease was suspected.Neuroimaging findings MRI did not reveal stroke lesions but multiple flow voids in the basal ganglia. The presence of stenosis of the terminal portion of the right intracranial internal carotid artery was shown by MRA. Left internal carotid angiography revealed no stenosis of the internal carotid artery, and right anterior cerebral artery was supplied from the left anterior cerebral artery via anterior commissure artery. Right internal carotid angiography demonstrated the stenosis of the terminal portion of the internal carotid artery and no anterior cerebral artery . The middle cerebral artery distended compared to the left one . Moyamoya vessels developed at the top of the internal carotid artery . Suzuki stage was II or in transition between stage II and III. Xenon computed tomography (XeCT) showed 64.4 (at rest) and 73.9 ml/100 g/min (after diamox loading), and cerebrovascular reaction was 14.8 % in the right middle cerebral artery area . There was no markedly decreased uptake in the right middle cerebral artery area in comparison with the left side .
