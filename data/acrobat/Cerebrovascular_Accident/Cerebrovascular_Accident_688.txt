A 53-year-old man with well-controlled hypertension was admitted to our hospital for the sudden onset of vertigo and gait disturbance. A physical examination showed normal vital signs, except for high blood pressure (190/81 mmHg). A neurological examination showed vertigo, mild dysphagia, hiccups, mild left hemiparesis and dysesthesia on the right side of the patient's body, including his face. Brain computed tomography (CT) and T2*W MRI showed hemorrhage in the medulla oblongata, which explained these symptoms ( , B). In addition, T2*W MRI revealed multiple small hypointense lesions in other areas, namely the cerebellar hemisphere, pons and middle cerebellar peduncle . These lesions were observed only on T2*W MRI and exhibited features suggestive of cerebral microbleeds. Fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) imaging showed no leukoaraiosis, and magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) demonstrated no evidence of vascular malformation. Laboratory testing disclosed the following findings: hemoglobin: 11.7 g/dL, platelet count: 24.8×10 4 / μL, blood urea nitrogen: 11.3 mg/dL, creatinine: 0.82 g/dL,creatinine clearance: 78 mL/min, PT-INR: 1.08 and APTT: 28.3 s. A transthoracic echocardiogram revealed no abnormalities. The patient's symptoms gradually improved under conservative treatment and rehabilitation. A neurological examination showed no deficits, except for dizziness. Therefore, he was discharged on hospital day 35. One month later, follow-up MRI showed the detailed appearance of a cerebral microbleed-like lesion . Four months later, another obvious lesion was detected in the midbrain tegmentum , which subsequently ruptured 18 months later ( shown). Nine months later, the patient presented with a high level of plasma transforming growth factor β1 (TGF-β1: 4.26 ng/mL; normal range: 0.89±1.80 ng/mL); the plasma vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) level was 5.09 pg/mL (normal control: <38.3 pg/mL).
