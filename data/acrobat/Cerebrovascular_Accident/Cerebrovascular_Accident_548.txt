A 24-year-old man presented with spontaneous pulsatile tinnitus, progressive headache, right chemosis, and right abducens nerve palsy. His mother had a history of dissection of the thoracic aorta and had been diagnosed with EDS type IV. His grandmother had died from cerebral apoplexy. The patient was diagnosed with EDS type IV based on clinical presentation, physical examination, family history, and confirmation of a mutation in the COL3A1 gene after the onset of CCF. INVESTIGATIONS MR angiography revealed a right CCF, as evidenced by dilatation of the superior ophthalmic vein (SOV), superficial middle cerebral vein (SMCV), and right cavernous sinus ( , B). MR angiography also showed tortuous change of the right internal carotid artery (ICA) at the prepetrous portion. Susceptibility weighted venogram MR angiography at admission showing an abnormally dilated right superficial middle cerebral vein (arrows) and bilateral superior ophthalmic veins (arrowheads) as an indication of a carotidâ€“cavernous fistula (A, B). Susceptibility weighted venogram imaging reveals marked venous congestion in the right cerebral hemisphere (C). imaging showed marked venous congestion in the right cerebral hemisphere . Preoperative CT angiography did not show evidence of arterial dissection at the cervical portion of the right common carotid arterial wall. To avoid transfemoral arteriography, we planned direct carotid artery and jugular vein puncture via direct neck dissection for the purposes of interventional coil embolization. Furthermore, we decided to undertake transvenous coil embolization using triple microcatheters to achieve safe and complete sinus packing without coil extension to the ICA via the fistula. Written informed consent was obtained from the patient prior to the intervention.
