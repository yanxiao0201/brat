# Our purpose is to guarantee that every case report can be described as a continuous time series. Here is a list of rules to help you:
	# 1. Annotate adjacent entities.  For example, for the following sentences, “A happens. B happens. C happens.” We only need to annotate (A before B) and (B before C), even if there is no explicit temporal relation between A and B. We assume the time progresses continuously across sentences. Do NOT annotate (A before C) since it is unnecessary;
	# 2. A time expression should be connected with only one entity, because ideally all the events are placed in a continuous time series, there will be duplicates if a time expression is connected to two entities;
	# 3. Only activity, sign symptom, disease disorder, procedure, medication, and lab should be considered when annotating temporal relations, because it doesn’t make sense to compare demographics, anatomical structure, etc. with each other or a time expression;
	# 4. The direction of arrows for temporal relations should be forward, i.e. from a previous entity to a later one. Note it doesn’t apply to the relation of modifier.
