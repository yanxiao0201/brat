A 43-year-old woman was referred for surgery for severe symptomatic mitral regurgitation. Echocardiography confirmed a myxomatous mitral valve and anterior leaflet prolapse. She had few comorbidities but had undergone a complete right pneumonectomy at the age of 5 years following a motor vehicle accident. Her chest radiograph showed complete displacement of the mediastinal structures to the right hemithorax . Notably, a small amount of aerated lung was observed in the right upper hemithorax, which confirmed displacement of the left lung well into the right chest. A preoperative computed tomography scan was performed, which confirmed rightward displacement of her ascending aorta . In fact, her interatrial groove was displaced posteriorly towards her thoracic vertebrae . A sternotomy was thought to provide very poor visualization of the ascending aorta, right atrium, and interatrial groove. Therefore, the operation was performed through a right lateral thoracotomy in the 4th intercostal space. This approach allowed central arterial and venous cannulation, in addition to direct aortic crossclamping and antegrade cardioplegic arrest. Carbon dioxide insufflation was also employed. The mitral valve was repaired with an edge-to-edge sutureapplied medially along with ring annuloplasty using a Medtronic Future band (Medtronic, Inc., Minneapolis, MN, USA). Intraoperative echocardiography confirmed no mitral regurgitation following repair. The patient was subsequently discharged home in a stable condition 4 days after surgery.
