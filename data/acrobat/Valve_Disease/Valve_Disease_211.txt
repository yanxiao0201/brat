A one-year-old male was diagnosed with an ALVT and was referred to our department for surgical correction. Transthoracic and transesophageal echocardiography and cardiac catheterization were interpreted as showing an ALVT arising superior to the left sinus of Valsalva and aortic regurgitation between the left and the noncoronary cusps ( and B). Aortogram showed grade III aortic regurgitation . Left ventricular diastolic diameter measured by echo cardiogram was 38 mm (Z score Â¼ 4.19). Chest x-rays showed severe cardiomegaly. We planned surgical repair of the ALVT.
