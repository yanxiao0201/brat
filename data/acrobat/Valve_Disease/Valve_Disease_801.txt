A 75-year-old patient with a history of multiple endovascular and surgical interventions on the aorta was admitted to our clinic due to a rapid infra-renal aneurysm enlargement (10 cm × 9,5 cm) following endovascular aorto-bi-iliac stenting with a GORE Excluder stentgraft (W. L. ) in September 2009 . Furthermore, he was already treated with an endovascular stenting of an aneurysm in the descending thoracic aorta (2004) and an hybrid operation of a new developed aortic arch aneurysm with a combined endovascular stenting of the aortic arch (Gore TAG stentgraft (45 × 200mm)) and an aorto-truncal, aortosubclavian and leftsided aorto-carotic bypass . Computed tomography (CT) showed an enlargement of the endovascularly excluded abdominal aortic aneurysm and a conspicuous new para-aortic hematoma and contrast agent enrichment in the aneurysm sac . Preoperative transesophageal echocardiography revealed a critical aortic stenosis with a tri-leaflet heavily calcified valve, with an aortic valve area of 0.8 cm 2 and a low-flow/Strasse 62, 50937 Cologne, Germany Full list of author information is available at the end of the article low-gradient stenosis with a peak velocity of 2.3 m/s, a mean gradient of 11 mmHg and a severe reduced left ventricular function (LVEF 20 %). After discussion in our multidisciplinary heart team we decided to perform a TF TAVI in combination with a simultaneous surgical abdominal aneurysm repair. However, in a patient with previous aortic endovascular interventions, there is a risk for the balloon expandable Edwards Sapien valve frame to get stucked to the aortic stents. Hence, we used a special technique to facilitate easy device passage through the stents.
