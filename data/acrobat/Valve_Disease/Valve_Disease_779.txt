A Caucasian woman presented with multiple cutaneous diffuse lentigines and cafe-au-lait spots (7 spots of 0.7 to 5 cm of diameters, localized in the palms, feet, trunk and buttock) since the age of 6 years ( D), associated with mild bilateral ptosis, facial dysmorphism (such as prognathism necessitating surgery, macroglossia) and pulmonary valve stenosis. Her body weight and height was in the normal age-range and she had no psychomotor delay, working as a commercial manager. Ophthalmologic examination revealed multiple peripheral retinal lentigines. Family history was negative for neurological or cutaneous symptoms. She was re-examined at the age of 41 years, related to the development of progressive painful dysaesthesias. Neurological examination revealed moderate sensorymotor deficit in all four limbs, with mild facial weakness. Conventional nerve conduction studies of the upper and lower limbs were normal, but late spinal F latencies were diffusely prolonged, suggesting diffuse proximal neuropathy. Spinal MRI revealed hypertrophic cervicobrachial and lumbo-sacral plexi and roots ( , F). Extensive diagnostic work-up excluded other inflammatory, genetic or tumor conditions associated with hypertrophic neuropathies . MRI of the lower limbsshowed two gadolinium-enhanced T2-hyperintense nodules (not shown), suggestive of neurofibromas. Sequencing of the NF1 gene showed no mutation (including search for intragenic rearrangements by MLPA analysis), while sequencing of the PTPN11 gene revealed a heterozygous missense mutation in Exon 12 (c.1403C > T, p.Thr468Met), confirming the diagnosis of LS.
