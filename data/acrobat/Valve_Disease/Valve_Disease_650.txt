An 80-year-old woman without any history of cardiovascular disease presented to our emergency room with the sudden onset of chest pain and dyspnea. On examination, her blood pressure was 65/49 mmHg and heart rate was 121/min. Her neck veins were distended, but she had no pretibial edema. There was a grade 3/6 holosystolic murmur at the apex and bilateral moist rales throughout the lung fields. Troponin-T was positive and brain natriuretic peptide was elevated to 1170 pg/ml. The electrocardiogram provided evidence of acute lateral myocardial infarction and the chest radiograph showed bilateral pulmonary edema. Transthoracic echocardiography was performed, revealing a mobile mass attached to the mitral valve leaflet (suggesting a ruptured papillary muscle) , severe mitral regurgitation with prolapse of both mitral leaflets, and severe hypokinesis of the lateral wall of the left ventricle. Arterial blood gas analysis revealed hypoxia and severe hypercapnia, so she was intubated and mechanical ventilation was started immediately.
