The patient was seen 4 months later, after being admitted to the hospital with pneumonia. She improved but was not functioning at full energy level. Because of the change in clinical status, another TTE was performed that showed mild global left ventricular hypokinesis (ejection fraction, 45%), moderate mitral regurgitation, and moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension, with no change in aortic stenosis peak gradient or valve area severity. Based on the presence of severe aortic stenosis with heart failure and signs of cardiac dysfunction, the patient was referred for elective coronary angiography and aortic valve intervention. 8 Angiography demonstrated no significant coronary artery disease and 1 month later, she underwent transcatheter aortic valve implantation with no complications. One year postintervention, the patient has improved energy level and exercise capacity and continues to live independently.
