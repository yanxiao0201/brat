Patient 1 was hospitalized at age 5 weeks because of feeding problems and cyanosis. X-thorax showed a grossly enlarged heart. Echocardiography revealed a moderately dilated left ventricle with severe systolic dysfunction. The apical wall of the left ventricle was excessively thickened with prominent hypertrabeculation. The left and right atria showed mild dilatation. A small secundum atrial septal defect (ASD) was also present. Within 2 weeks the X-thorax and echocardiography revealed further enlargement of the heart (heart–thorax ratio ± 0.7) with severe left ventricular hypertrophy and deep trabeculations in the apex (interventricular septum in diastole (IVSd) 12 mm, Z+10; left ventricular posterior wall in diastole (LVPWd) 10 mm, Z+10) and a fractional shortening (FS) of the left ventricle of 10% (left ventricular internal dimension (LVID) 23/26). The child died from cardiac failure at age 12 weeks. Macroscopic examination of the heart revealed severe cardiomegaly and dilatation with a total weight of 115 g (normalc.

weight at this age, 30 g). Right ventricular thickening was noted, especially of the posterior wall. The anterior wall of the left ventricle was severely thickened and showed abnormal trabeculation and multiple intertrabecular recesses as seen in noncompaction cardiomyopathy. Secundum ASD was confirmed. No other congenital malformations were found. Microscopic examination of cardiac tissue  showed myofibrillar disarray in both the ventricular septum and the left ventricular wall. Hypertrophic myocytes with a diameter of 20–30 μm (normal 12 μm) and multiple vacuoles on electron microscopy suggested glycogenosis . As the echocardiographic images and ECG did not suggest Pompe disease and urine oligosaccharide analysis was normal, no α-glucosidase enzyme or molecular assay was performed. MYBPC3 mutation analysis revealed compound heterozygosity for the pathogenic mutations c.2373dup p.(Trp792fs) and c.2827C4T p.(Arg943*). Both pathogenic mutations are known founder mutations within the Dutch HCM population. 10,11 Neither parent had cardiac symptoms. Initial echocardiography revealed no abnormalities in the 32-year-old mother, who was heterozygous for c.2373dup, nor in the 31-year-old father, heterozygous for c.2827C4T. ECG in the father showed mild repolarization abnormalities (ST elevation of 0.5 mm in V1, followed by a negative T in V1–V4). Re-evaluation after 7 years revealed moderate septal hypertrophy (HCM) with an interventricular septum of 14 mm in the mother, and interventricular septal measurements at the upper limit of the normal range (12 mm) in the father. The family history of both parents was positive for HCM and sudden death . Patient 2 had feeding problems in the first weeks of life and dyspnea and mild hypotonia were noticed at age 4 weeks. A grossly enlarged heart was observed on the X-thorax (heart–thorax ratio 0.8%) and low oxygen saturation blood levels were found. Echocardiography revealed moderately dilated ventricles with severe diastolic and systolic dysfunction. Hypertrabeculation with flow perfused intertrabecular recesses was present in both ventricles, including the apical walls . An apical muscular ventricular septal defect (VSD) was visualized, although deep recessal flow complicated interpretation of the images. Unfortunately, owing to the critically ill status of the patient, there are no reliable M-mode measurements of the left ventricle. A muscle computed tomography scan showed no signs of atrophy, and a muscular biopsy revealed no congenital myopathy. His condition deteriorated at age 12 weeks and he died.
In this case too, we identified compound heterozygosity for the pathogenic c.2373dup p.(Trp792fs) and c.2827C4T p.(Arg943*) mutations in the MYBPC3 gene. The parents agreed neither to an autopsy on the child nor to cardiologic evaluation for themselves or pedigree analysis. The third proband presented with severe feeding problems and signs of cardiac decompensation at age 7 weeks. Cardiomegaly was seen on chest X-ray, and echocardiography showed HCM with dilated ventricles. M-Mode measurements were unavailable. Noncompaction was not a clear feature, but could not be excluded. There was a small foramen ovale and mitral valve insufficiency. The condition of the patient deteriorated owing to a viral infection and she died at age 12 weeks. The parents did not give permission for autopsy and, at that time, molecular analysis of genes involved in cardiomyopathy was not available. Cardiac analyses of first-degree relatives were normal. Eleven years later, a cousin of the father presented with cardiac arrest due to HCM. He had a heterozygous pathogenic c.2373dup p.(Trp792fs) mutation in MYBPC3. We subsequently confirmed homozygosity for the c.2373dup variant in DNA isolated from stored fibroblasts from the deceased proband. Both parents of the proband were heterozygous for this truncating variant . Cardiac re-evaluation showed only slightly reduced ECG voltages in the father (age 38) and borderline hypertrophy (septal thickness 11 mm) in the mother (age 41).
Patient 4 presented with dyspnea, hypotension, feeding difficulties, and failure to thrive at age 6 weeks. Echocardiography showed severe HCM with features of noncompaction, and severe diastolic and systolic left ventricular dysfunction (IVSd 11 mm, Z+10; LVPWd 10 mm, Z+10, FS 13% (LVID 17/20) and left ventricular mass 255 g/m 2 ). A secundum ASD with a left–right shunt was also observed. One week later she died after an unsuccessful resuscitation. Homozygosity for the c.2827C4T p.(Arg943*) nonsense mutation in MYBPC3 was found. Both parents were heterozygous for this pathogenic mutation. Her mother was diagnosed with postpartum HCM with diastolic dysfunction, confirmed by cardiac MRI, at age 26. Echocardiography of the father was normal; ECG showed a right bundle branch block. A paternal uncle of patient 4 had died aged 3 months of unknown cause .Literature review The results of our literature review are summarized in , showing 21 cases (including our four cases) of double-truncating pathogenic mutations, all presented neonatally or in early childhood. Fifteen died before the age of 1 year; the others had either undergone transplantations or were severely affected. Structural defects were detected in 13 cases, but neither hypertrabecularization nor deep intertrabecular recesses were described in any of the previously reported cases.
