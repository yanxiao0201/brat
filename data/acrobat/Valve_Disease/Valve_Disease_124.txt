A 55-year-old male with a 17-year history of recurrent chest distress which had aggravated 1 week earlier presented to our hospital. About 17 years ago, the patient begun to feel effort-related chest distress and shortness of breath. For a long time, this patient had received antiarrhythmic drugs, diuretics and a drug to improve ventricular remodeling with no history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus or renal functional impairment. Findings on physical examination were within normal limits (stable vital signs, no pulmonary rales, no pathologic murmur, etc.). Laboratory examination showed D-dimer negative. Ventilationâ€“perfusion scintigraphy was performed with 99m Tc-diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid ( 99m Tc-DTPA) aerosol for ventilation phase and 99m Tc-macroaggregated albumin ( 99m Tc-MAA) for perfusion phase. Lung perfusion scan disclosed total absence of perfusion in the right lung , while ventilation scan disclosed decreased size of the right lung with diminished but homogeneousradioactivity distribution when compared to the left . Despite the non-classical imaging result, this mismatch was interpreted as probable acute PE. However, considering the patient's signs, symptoms and results of laboratory examination, acute PE was suspected and a congenital anomaly of the right lung or proximal pulmonary artery branch stenosis was considered to be an alternative diagnosis. For further evaluation, CTA was performed. The imaging of the CTA demonstrated occlusion of the right main pulmonary artery with no evidence of embolus  and numerous anomalous arteries in transverse section were unexpectedly found . Pulmonary window setting showed decreased size of the right lung . Three-dimensional reconstruction demonstrated large, tortuous collateral vessels arising from the left circumflex coronary artery to the affected lung (Figs. 1d, 2b).
