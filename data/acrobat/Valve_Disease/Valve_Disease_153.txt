A 83-year-old woman with history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia. The blood pressure and hyperlipidemia were well-controlled with medication. She was admitted to our hospital with chest pain on effort and exertional shortness of breath. Her vital sign was stable with blood pressure 131/70 mmHg and heart rate 67 beats per minute at initial presentation. A mid-systolic ejection murmur was heard along the left sternal border with chest X-ray showed minor pulmonary congestion. Incidental high resting LV mid-wall pressure gradient (86 mmHg, ) was shown by 2dimensional echocardiography without LV septal wall thickness (8.5 mm). The LV end-diastolic volume was 90 ml, and LV end-systolic volume was 27 ml. Apparently hypertrophied anterolateral (A) and posteromedial (P) papillary muscles together with a large, third accessory PM were observed . Neither aortic stenosis nor SAM was observed. Complete ECG disclosed obvious U wave (V1-V4) with normal QT interval (416ms, ). Blood level of B-natriuretic peptide was obviously elevated (227 pg/ml). Repeated 2D transthoracic echocardiogram during hospitalization revealed no more pressure gradient (plummeted to 5 mmHg) after holding diuretics . Meanwhile, she was in euvolemic state with blood pressure 128/76 mmHg and heart rate 62 beats per minute. To further clarify the spatial relationships between these hypertrophied PMs and other LV wall segments, real-time 3D echocardiography (RT-3DE) was performed and showed nearly complete LV mid-wall cavity obliteration by the these morphological abnormal PMs during end-systolic phase (
