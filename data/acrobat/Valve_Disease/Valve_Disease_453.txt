A 65-year-old woman was referred for surgical treatment of aortic valve stenosis. She had been taking minocycline hydrochloride for >30 years for treatment of hidradenitis. Her medical history included iron-deficiency anaemia, for which she was on a longterm oral iron replacement therapy. She had noticed persistent blue-black pigmentation of both of her lower extremities. She was otherwise well and denied having discoloured urine. At operation, the ascending aorta was faintly stained with a blue-black pigment. Viewing from inside the aorta, blue-black discolouration was found on the aortic valve leaflets, the sinuses of Valsalva and in the left ventricular outflow tract . The aortic valve was found to be tricuspid, sclerotic, severely calcified and had dense discolouration near the commissural attachment to the aortic root . The aortic valve was excised and was replaced with a 23-mm Trifecta™ bovine pericardial prosthesis (St Jude Medical, Inc., St Paul, MN, USA). Microscopic examination of the excised valve revealed finely granular dark pigment deposited diffusely in the fibrous layer of the aortic valve cusp near the commissural attachment to the aortic root, the coapting surface of the valve leaflet and in the mid-portion of the leaflet ( ; H&E, ×100). Similar granular dark pigment was deposited diffusely in the intimal and most superficial medial layers of the sinuses of Valsalva and in the aortic wall ( ; H&E ×100). Fontana staining of the aortic valve leaflet demonstrated relative accentuation of pigment staining in the valve tissue, suggesting a positive reaction ( ; FontanaMasson ×100). The patient's postoperative recovery was uneventful and she remained well when last seen for her 1-year postoperative evaluation.
