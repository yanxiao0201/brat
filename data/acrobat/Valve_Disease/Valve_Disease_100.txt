A 20-year-old woman presented to our emergency department with chest pain, exertional dyspnea and pyrexia. She had a history of miscarriage in the 1st trimester, light smoking, and tendonitis. A chest CT-scan excluded pulmonary embolism but showed acute pulmonary edema and hydropericardium. Transthoracic echocardiography confirmed hydropericardium and showed severe mitral stenosis (mean transvalvular pressure = 32 mmHg) caused by a global thickening of the endocardium (Movie 1). Therefore, cardiac contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed to study the unusual endocardial thickening. A dedicated MRI protocol was used taking into account the difficulties to obtain breath-holds. Analysis of long-axis cine views demonstrated a thickening of both the mitral valve and the surrounding endocardial tissue ( , Movie 2). First-pass perfusion short-axis acquisition showed a perfusion defect of the basal endocardium ( , Movie 3). Delayed enhancement performed 10 min after contrast administration using an inversion-recovery gradient short-axis echo sequence exhibited circumferential enhancement of the basal subvalvular endocardium, highly suggestive of endocardial fibrosis fibrous endocardium with ulcerations . No specific granulomas were found. All blood cultures were negative. Immunological analysis showed the presence of antinuclear and antiphospholipid antibodies.
