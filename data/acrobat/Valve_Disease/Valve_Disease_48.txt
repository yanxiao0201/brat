Technique The patient had a median sternotomy and cardiopulmonary bypass was established with arterial return to the aorta and venous drainage with bicaval cannulation. The patient was cooled to 28°C. Antegrade and retrograde blood cardioplegia were used for myocardial protection. Distal coronary anastomoses were performed to the left anterior descending (LAD), the diagonal and the obtuse marginal (OM) coronary arteries and the posterior descending artery (PDA) of the right coronary artery (RCA). A ventriculotomy was then carried out as part of the Dor repair. A 4-mm GORE-TEX® graft (W.L. Gore and Associates, Livingston, UK) was placed around the papillary muscles just to approximate them and, then, a Hemashield patch (Maquet UK, Boldon Colliery, UK) was inserted to exclude the septal aneurysm, using interrupted 2-0 pledgeted Ticron sutures (Covidien UK, Fareham, UK). The ventriculotomy was then closed with two layers of 2-0 Prolene sutures (Ethicon Uk Ltd., Livingston, UK) supported by a strip of Teflon sandwiching the patch in the process. The proximal anastomoses were then performed and the patient re-warmed and weaned off bypass with a small inotropic support. Post-operative transoesophageal echocardiogram showed mild impairment of left ventricular function and trace mitral regurgitation. Cardiac MRI was performed one month post-operatively and it showed that the approximation of the papillary muscles was working well and there was mild impairment of left ventricular function (Figure1A, B, C).
