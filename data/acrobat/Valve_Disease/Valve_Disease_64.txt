Fetal hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is most commonly seen in the setting of maternal diabetes mellitus and typically resolves spontaneously in the first few weeks after delivery. Rarely, fetal HCM may be secondary to a familial genetic mutation, classically a mutation in one of the contractile proteins of the cardiac sarcomere. In this situation, the condition can have serious long-term clinical consequences . We report the intrauterine course and management of a baby girl born to a 30-year-old, G6P2 mother who initially presented for prenatal care at 7 weeks of gestation. There was no maternal history of diabetes mellitus, and gestational diabetes screening performed in the pregnancy was normal.
