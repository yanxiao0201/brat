A three-year-old, 12 kg female underwent cardiac transplant with bicaval connection. Her previous diagnosis was heterotaxy with complete atrioventricular (AV) canal with anomalous entry of the inferior vena cava and right hepatic veins to the left atrium and partial cor triatriatum. She had previously undergone pulmonary artery (PA) band placement (age four months). She then underwent removal of PA band and complete intracardiac repair including resection of the cor triatriatum, with left AV valve annuloplasty and baffle of the inferior vena cava to right atrium (age eight months). The operation was complicated by complete heart block, and a permanent pacemaker was implanted. She developed progressive AV valve insufficiency and a 25 mm St Jude prosthesis was placed (age 12 months). Following this, she had gradually progressive left ventricular dysfunction and eventually refractory congestive heart failure. She underwent cardiac transplantation at age 3. She underwent a routine catheterization/biopsy procedure one week after orthotopic heart transplantation. This and all subsequent procedures were performed from the right internal jugular vein. Superior venal cava (SVC) and right atrial (RA) pressures (in mm Hg) were elevated with mean 20 and Vwave of 26 and International Society for Heart Lung Transplantation Grade 2R rejection on histology. Mild TR was noted on subsequent echocardiogram. The rejection was treated with intravenous methylprednisolone. She underwent two additional catheterizations in the first postoperative month. These were free of rejection but elevated RA mean pressure and prominent A wave remained. Following the second procedure, there was a marked worsening in the echocardiographic TR with evidence of flail tricuspid valve leaflet on echocardiography. She was also noted to have significant echocardiographic and angiographic evidence of progressive SVC
