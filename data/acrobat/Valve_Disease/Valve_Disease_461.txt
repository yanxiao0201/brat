A 71-year old female was admitted to the emergency room complaining of a 72-h episode of resting dyspnoea, orthopnoea and haemoptysis. She had undergone aortic valve replacement 3 years before (in July 2010, Trifecta 21-mm, St Jude Medical, Inc). She had medical history of arterial hypertension, transient ischaemic attack (on anti-thrombotic therapy with clopidogrel) and fibromyalgia (she was not under immunosuppressive corticosteroid therapy). The patient reported an accidental fall without the loss of consciousness. Physical examination revealed an arterial blood pressure of 103/35 mmHg, bilateral crepitant rales and aorticdiastolic murmur that was not present at the routine visit (1 month before admission). Pulmonary congestion was seen on chest radiography. Transthoracic (TTE) and transoesophageal echocardiography (TOE) data were consistent with acute severe aortic regurgitation, and echocardiogram findings ruled out any evidence of endocarditis . Aortic insufficiency was not present in the routine follow-up echo images. Aortic prosthetic valve replacement was performed on an urgent basis. The surgical findings showed a parastent tear in the non-coronary cusp, beginning at the top of the post, and extending to the nadir . The prosthetic and the native annulus were intact without any paravalvular leak. A 21-mm St Jude Epic prosthesis was implanted. The postoperative period progressed without any complication. The patient was extubated 3 h after leaving the operating theatre, no inotropic drugs were used. Hospital discharge was at the 6 postoperative day. Blood cultures and microbiological analysis of the prosthesis were unremarkable.
