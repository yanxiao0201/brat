A 58-year-old man was admitted with effort dyspnea and angina. The physical examination was normal except for an apical 3/6 systolic murmur. A telecardiogram was normal, and an electrocardiogram showed sinus rhythm with no sign of ischemia. Transthoracic echocardiography revealed severe mitral insufficiency, mild aortic and tricuspid insufficiency, an ejection fraction of 50%, a systolic pulmonary artery pressure of 45 mm Hg, and a borderline large left ventricle. There was 80% stenosis in the mid section and 70% stenosis after diagonal 2 in the LAD, and the left main coronary artery was normal in coronary angiography . The circumflex artery was normal, extending to the right coronary area after the origin of the posterior descending artery . The right coronary artery was absent. Intense escape of radiopaque material to the left atrium and mitral insufficiency were observed in left ventriculography . The patient was operated on after informed consent was acquired. Ascending aortic and bicaval cannulation were performed after a median sternotomy and pericardiotomy. Arrest was achieved by giving anterograde isothermic blood cardioplegia through the aortic root under normothermic cardiopulmonary bypass.Retrograde blood cardioplegia was continued through the coronary sinus. The left atrium was entered through the interatrial groove. Normal leaflet structure and annular dilatation were observed on mitral valve exploration. Plication and annuloplasty with a no. 29 Duran flexible ring were performed on the P2 scallop of the posterior leaflet. The LAD was bypassed with the left internal mammary artery, and diagonal 2 was bypassed with a saphenous vein graft. The patient was transferred to the ward on the second day after the operation. He had no postoperative problems and was discharged on the 7th day. Transthoracic echocardiography showed no mitral insufficiency perioperatively or on the 5th postoperative day.
