A 29-year-old man, a nonsmoker with no medical history, presented with chest pain, orthopnea, and easy fatigability (non-ST segment elevation MI) for 1 month. He had no cardiovascular risk factors. Although he mentioned that his father had died at the age of 51 years due to a cerebrovascular accident, there was no documented family history of premature IHD. Coronary angiography revealed chronic total occlusion of the LMCA  with retrograde perfusion via a normal dominant right coronary artery . Echocardiography showed a left ventricular ejection fraction less than 25% and grade IV (severe) mitral regurgitation. A carotid Doppler study was normal with no evidence of stenosis. However, the left vertebral artery appeared ectatic with multiple areas of narrowing on neck magnetic resonance imaging with contrast. The patient underwent urgent coronary artery bypass graft surgery with distal anastomosis of the left internal mammary artery to the left anterior descending artery and an autologous saphenous vein graft bypassing the first obtuse marginal artery, in addition to mitral valve repair and intraaortic balloon pumping to augment native coronary perfusion. He was weaned from the intraaortic balloon pump and extubated 1 day later. Postoperative echocardiography showed a left ventricular ejection fraction of 30% and mild mitral regurgitation.
