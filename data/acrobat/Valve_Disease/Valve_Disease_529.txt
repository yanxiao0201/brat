ventricular septal compression; the right ventricle was mildly dilated and hypokinetic. On the fourth day, a transesophageal echocardiogram again showed marked asymmetric left ventricular hypertrophy and systolic anterior motion of the anterior mitral-valve leaflet. The tip of the middle scallop of the posterior mitralvalve leaflet was flail, with an associated chordal remnant. There was severe mitral regurgitation with an eccentrically directed jet, severe tricuspid regurgitation, and right ventricular dilatation and dysfunction.  Dr. Rhee: On the fifth day, flow cytometry of the peripheral blood showed no evidence of a monoclonal B-cell or unusual T-cell population. Testing for antibodies to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and blood cultures were negative.shows thickening of the right paratracheal stripe and prominence of the hila, findings suggestive of lymphadenopathy; also shown are reticular interstitial opacities, which are suggestive of pulmonary edema. A chest CT scan, obtained according to the pulmonary‑embolism protocol at maximum intensity projection of the right pulmonary tree (Panel B) and the left pulmonary arterial tree (Panel C), shows mediastinal and hilar ad‑ enopathy (asterisks) and normal filling of the pulmonary arteries without filling defects, findings that indicate an absence of pulmonary embolism; punctate calcifications, which are present bilaterally, correspond to calcified gran‑ ulomas. An axial CT scan, obtained through the upper ventricular septum and left ventricular outflow tract during systole (Panel D), shows relative thickening of the upper basal septum (asterisk) and systolic anterior motion of the anterior mitral‑valve leaflet (arrow). A coronal reconstruction CT scan (Panel E) shows right parasternal adenopathy and bilateral hilar adenopathy (arrows).The next day, a diagnostic procedure was performed.
