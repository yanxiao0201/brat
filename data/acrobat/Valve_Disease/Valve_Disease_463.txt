The first patient was a 75-year old female presenting in New York Heart Association-Classification (NYHA) class III with severe aortic valve stenosis with an aortic annulus diameter of 21 mm [aortic valve area (AVA) 0.70 cm 2 ]. (For subsequent information about Case 1, see Supplementary material). The operation was performed via right anterolateral thoracotomy. Aortic annulus diameter was measured to be 21 mm. The patient received a Perceval S sutureless aortic valve size M (21 mm â‰¤ aortic annulus diameter <23 mm). Per routine, the prosthesis was checked visually after crimping, after deployment and after post-dilatation according to the manufacturer's protocol. Each sinus of the aortic annulus was checked individually for correct stent alignment and symmetric positioning. A water test was performed to rule out significant transvalvular or PVL. The intraoperative control echocardiography showed normal valve function. The early postoperative course was uneventful. The patient was readmitted to the intensive care unit on the third postoperative day (POD) due to respiratory failure and low cardiac output syndrome. Transoesophageal echocardiography (TOE) showed a transvalvular gradient of 50/24 mmHg (max/mean) and a moderate-to-severe trans-and paravalvular aortic insufficiency (AI). The patient was reoperated immediately. On inspection, the aortic valve stent was seen to have inwardly kinked at the non-coronary sinus  resulting in insufficient alignment. The sutureless valve was replaced using a conventional biological aortic valve prosthesis (SJM Trifecta, size 21 mm). Postoperative transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) showed normal aortic valve function
