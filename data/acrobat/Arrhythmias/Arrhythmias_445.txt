A 64-year-old female lifelong smoker with no previous cardiac history presented with a 4-day history of dyspnoea on minimal exertion (New York Heart Association class III). Electrocardiography showed broad complex monophasic ventricular tachycardia (VT) and troponin T was elevated. She was treated initially with intravenous amiodarone and adenosine with no sustained effect. Transthoracic echocardiography showed a severely dilated left ventricle (LV) with a large aneurysm and severely impaired ventricular function. The ejection fraction was less than 10%. Coronary angiography showed a long segment of moderate to severe disease in the left coronary system and a small right coronary artery with no flow limiting disease. Recurrent intermittent episodes of VT became persistent and intractable. Direct current cardioversion was attempted on at least 20 separate occasions, resulting in only transient amelioration of arrhythmia. Percutaneous coronary intervention was undertaken successfully to the left anterior descending artery to reduce ischaemic burden. Multiple defibrillations were required during the procedure. Intra-aortic counterpulsation balloon pump and transvenous pacing were inserted owing to increasing haemodynamic instability of the patient and VT unresponsive to medical treatment. The patient underwent emergency remodelling of the LV combined with subendocardial resection of the arrhythmogenic scar tissue. LV remodelling was accomplished by insertion of an elliptical patch of porcine pericardium at the junction of the normal myocardium and scar tissue. The operation was guided by three-dimensional transoesophageal echocardiography (TOE). The immediate postoperative TOE showed an ejection fraction of 67.2% (10% preoperatively) and estimated LV stroke volume of 58.2ml. The patient made an uneventful recovery from surgery with complete resolution of VT. She was discharged home ten days later.
