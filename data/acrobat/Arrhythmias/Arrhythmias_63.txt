A 79-year-old African American man was referred to an outpatient nephrology clinic for evaluation of renal dysfunction discovered incidentally during a routine follow-up the week before. His blood urea nitrogen (BUN) was 52 mg/dL (Ref: 9-23 mg/dL), serum creatinine (Cr) was 2.9 mg/dL (Ref: 0.7-1.3 mg/dL), and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was 27.2 ml/min/1.73 (Ref: > 60 ml/ min/1.73). He had fatigue but no other symptoms. Three months previously, his Cr was 1.3 mg/dL, eGFR was 69 ml/min/1.73 and hemoglobin was 11.0 g/dL (Ref: 12.5-16.5 g/dL) with normal white blood cell differential. His past medical history included hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and a recent diagnosis of atrial fibrillation. His medications included amlodipine 5 mg daily, valsartan 320 mg daily, rosuvastatin 10 mg daily, vitamin D 2000 units daily, and dabigatran 150 mg twice a day, started 6 weeks earlier for atrial fibrillation by his cardiologist. He had undergone no interventional procedures. On physical examination, his blood pressure was elevated at 179/79 mm Hg. Laboratory tests revealed normal white blood cell count and differential, as well as normal platelet count and electrolytes. Hemoglobin was low at 10.0 g/dL. Urinalysis showed 1+ protein and > 20 red blood cells/ high power field (hpf ) (Ref: < 2/hpf ). Urine protein to creatinine ratio was 0.5 (Ref: 0.0-0.2). Repeat BUN was 50 mg/dL, Cr was 3.3 mg/dL, and eGFR was 22 ml/min/1.73. Urgent renal ultrasound with Doppler was ordered. However, on the day of the renal ultrasound, the patient's blood pressure was severely elevated at 243/109 mm Hg, prompting hospital admission. His hospitalization occurred 5 days after he was first
