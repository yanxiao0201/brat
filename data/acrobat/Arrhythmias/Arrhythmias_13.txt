A 65-year-old man was admitted to our hospital due to progressive dyspnea, which appeared 24 h earlier. One month previously, a dual-chamber pacemaker had been implanted in another hospital, because of intermittent second-degree atrioventricular block. Both leads were placed with active fixation. On admission, chest radiography revealed a borderline cardiothoracic index without typical signs of pericardial effusion . Clinical examination and echocardiography demonstrated a large pericardial effusion without signs of pericardial tamponade. The patient was transferred to the intensive care unit for further monitoring and medical treatment, maintaining haemodynamically stable. After a few hours, he became unstable and was supported with intravenous infusion of inotropic agents. Repeat echocardiography revealed typical signs of pericardial tamponade . Interrogation of the pacemaker was performed. The atrial lead manifested high impedance values and no ability to pace, making the diagnosis of cardiac perforation from the atrial lead very probable. An urgent median sternotomy was performed, and a huge pericardial effusion was drained. The patient's hemodynamics stabilized. An atrial appendage perforation with pericardial injury by the lead was revealed. The perforation site was sutured, and the sternal wound was closed. Interrogation of the device showed sufficient atrial pacing. He was discharged after an uneventful recovery.
