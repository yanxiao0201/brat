A 36-year-old man with an 8-year history of severe difficult-to-treat chronic urticaria/angioedema was referred to the divisions of allergology and dermatology (Department of Internal Diseases, Dermatology and Allergology) for therapy. So far the patient was treated by dermatologists and a GP. His symptoms were poorly controlled despite continuous therapy with oral prednisone (mean dose, 20 mg/day; range, 15–40 mg) for 8 years and higher doses of various antihistamines (to 3× standard doses). Any attempt to reduce the oral prednisone dose brought aggravation of the symptoms. Upon exacerbation of the disease symptoms the intravenous steroids were also administered. A successful H. pylori eradication was performed some years before, that however had no influence on the course of CSU. The diagnosis of CSU was based on typical urticarial lesions and recurrent angioedema without features of vasculitis in the skin biopsy findings . The patient did not give any history of other symptoms or diseases neither he take any other medications. His family history was insignificant.
