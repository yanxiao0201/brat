With a creatinine clearance >80 mL/ min, the half-life of dabigatran in the described patient is â‰ˆ13 hours. Based on the results of studies performed to date, it would be reasonable to recommend withholding 3 doses of dabigatran so that the drug is stopped 24 hours before the procedure and is held on the morning of the procedure. During the procedure, heparin will be given as described above. The patient can be advised to resume dabigatran therapy in the evening after the procedure provided that at least 4 to 8 hours have elapsed since sheath removal. Bridging with LMWH is unnecessary before the procedure because of the low risk of stroke in the short period that dabigatran therapy is withheld, and is not required after the procedure because of the rapid onset of action of dabigatran. This strategy is being prospectively evaluated in a large cohort study that is being conducted in Canada. In this study, dabigatran is withheld for 24 hours before ablation in patients with a creatinine clearance >50 mL/min and for 48 hours in those with a creatinine clearance of 30 to 50 mL/min and resumption of dabigatran is delayed for 8 hours after sheath removal. In addition to cohort studies like this, registries and randomized trials are needed to define the optimal periprocedural management of dabigatran and other NOACs in patients undergoing AF ablation.
