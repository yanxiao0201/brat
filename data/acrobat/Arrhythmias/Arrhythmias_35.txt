A 67-year-old diabetic man first presented with a fainting episode to a peripheral hospital where he was discovered to have impaired renal function and hyperkaliemia associated with symptomatic junctional bradycardia. He was transferred to a tertiary center with a cardiac facility for consideration of cardiac pacing after stabilization of hyperkaliemia. A right internal jugular vein catheter (IJC) was inserted for hemodialysis. A dual chamber pacemaker (Adapta; Medtronic, Inc., Minneapolis, MN, USA) was implanted in the left side with CapSureFix Novus (Medtronic, Inc., Minneapolis, MN, USA) 1F leads inserted through the left cephalic vein. One month after implantation, he had left radiocephalic arteriovenous fistula (RCAVF) construction, and noticed swelling of the left upper limb one week later. After 3 months, the left RCAVF had matured and was used for hemodialysis. However, the swelling increased with every dialysis session. A left venogram showed left axillary vein occlusion with collateral formation. Hence hemodialysis through the left RCAVF was stopped. The surgeon created a right RCAVF and inserted a right IJC for temporary dialysis access. The radial artery had moderate atherosclerotic changes. Subsequently, the right upper limb began to swell more severely. A repeat central venogram revealed occlusion of both subclavian veins. This was compounded by low blood flow through the right RCAVF during hemodialysis. Thus the surgeon ligated the left RCAVF and created a new right brachiocephalic fistula with temporary dialysis through the left IJC. The patient was referred backto the initial center for percutaneous intervention of the CVS. The occluded right subclavian vein was successfully stented with a Prote´ge´10Prote´ge´Prote´ge´10 Â 80-mm stent (EV3 Endovascular, Inc., Plymouth, MN, USA). The swelling in both arms gradually subsided.
