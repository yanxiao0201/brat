A 44-year old man with HCM developed chest pain with subsequent loss of consciousness. A diagnosis of repetitive monomorphic VT accompanied by HCM with apical aneurysm was established. As intravenous antiarrhythmic treatment was not effective, epicardial and endocardial catheter ablation was performed at the septum in the apical aneurysm border where voltage mapping indicated the focus of VT . However, catheter ablation failed to terminate the VT, and the patient was referred to our hospital. Electrocardiogram-gated computed tomography angiography (CTA) revealed a midventricular hypertrophied myocardium with a wall thickness of 30 mm and apical cavity ballooning ( and C). We decided to perform emergency surgery to eliminate VT and midventricular obstruction.
The operation was performed by median sternotomy and cardiopulmonary bypass with bicaval cannulation. The direct intracavitary pressure measurement showed a pressure gradient of 50 mmHg across the midventricular obstructive portion. After cardioplegic arrest, a 6-cm incision was made along the left anterior descending artery at the apex of the left ventricle (LV). The LV muscle from the apex to the mid-portion was resected gradually and carefully through the apical incision . Then, the apical aneurysm border in the septum was ablated from the epicardial and endocardial surface simultaneously using a cryoablation system (CCS-200, Cooper Surgical, Shelton, CT, USA) . The probe was cooled to −60°C and applied for 3 min. The incision was closed using double polypropylene running sutures. The direct pressure measurement revealed no pressure gradient across the mid-portion of the LV. The total mass of the resected LV muscle was 35.0 g . The postoperative course was uncomplicated. Postoperative CTA revealed the significantly augmented LV cavity ( and E). The patient remained free from VT recurrence at two years postoperatively.
