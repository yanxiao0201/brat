From , five patients with in-hospital witnessed cardiac arrest and pulmonary embolism were cannulated and placed on the ECLS system. All patients (four male and one female) were young (mean age 45 years) without serious co-morbidities, but with increased risk of thrombosis due to the injury pattern (spinal cord, pelvis, immobilization). Three patients developed a fulminant pulmonary embolism after orthopedic surgery and major trauma. Two patients with spinal cord injury were tetra-and paraplegic and were treated with ECLS during cardiac arrest due to massive, hemodynamically compromising acute pulmonary embolisms . In all patients, cardiopulmonary resuscitation was initiated immediately. Transthoracic echocardiography, performed on two patients, revealed a thrombus of the inferior vena cava that extended to the right ventricle. A computed tomography (CT) scan in three patients displayed a central pulmonary embolism. Direct thrombolysis therapy (100-150 mg Actilyse) yielded short-term stabilization of the circulation in three patients, but resuscitation had to be continued after a few minutes .
