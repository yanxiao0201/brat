We present an 8-year-old girl with a history of Wolff–Parkinson–White syndrome and recurrent episodes of SVT despite previous ablation. Her episodes of SVT did not respond to vagal manoeuvres, and she invariably required intravenous adenosine. She had originally been advised to try handstands as an SVT treatment by one of the authors, and for over a year she had been successfully doing handstands at home to revert her episodes of SVT without requiring either drugs or emergency department (ED) attendance. She presented to the ED one afternoon with SVT. She had been hesitant to do a handstand on this occasion as she had also experienced chest pain, which was not a usual symptom for her. On arrival to the ED she was well, although her ECG rhythm strip showed a regular narrow complex tachycardia at a rate of 250 bpm . Initial trial of the valsalva manoeuvre was unsuccessful. Having not heard of her success with handstands I was about to proceed with intravenous adenosine when the child turned to me and asked, 'Can't I just do a handstand?' I agreed to her suggestion, and to my surprise the monitoring showed a rapid reduction in heart rate and reversion to normal sinus rhythm at a rate of 125 bpm !
certainly paid off. The child received a more pleasant and less invasive treatment, and the paramedics and ED staff were not only entertained in the resuscitation room, but also learned a new, effective, simple and non-invasive treatment for SVT. Next time, before attempting cardioversion of SVT with intravenous drugs or electricity, in a haemodynamically stable patient, we would urge you to try a vagal manoeuvre. And if the patient is able to do a handstand, why not let them try one?Updated information and services can be found at:
