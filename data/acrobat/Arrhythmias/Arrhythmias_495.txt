A 57-year-old woman with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (AF) underwent catheter ablation. After pulmonary vein isolation, an intravenous injection of pilsicainide, a pure sodium channel blocker, was administered for the sustained AF. Premature ventricular beats began to appear and culminated in ventricular fibrillation (VF) storm. The notches at the end of the terminal portion of the QRS complexes on the ECG became more manifest in the V 2 , V 3 , and V 4 leads and were accompanied by a pause-dependent augmentation . The VF storm was suppressed and the notches disappeared by the administration of isoproterenol. No VF recurred after a tapering of the isoproterenol and the initiation of quinidine. A pause-dependent augmentation of the J wave was a specific finding for a VF storm in patients with idiopathic VF associated with early repolarization , and isoproterenol was effective in controlling VF . It was suggested that the VF storm was due to idiopathic VF, which was unmasked by pilsicainide. Additionally, autonomic modification brought about by the catheter ablation procedure may have played an important role in the induction of VF .
