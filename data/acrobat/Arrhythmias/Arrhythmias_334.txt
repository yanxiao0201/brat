An 82-year-old man presented in extremis following an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. His partner had commenced cardiopulmonary resuscitation and return of spontaneous circulation was achieved 25 minutes later. He had complained of non-specific upper abdominal pain for the last two days and had been continually retching although not vomiting. On direct questioning, his partner reported that he had sustained significant left arm injuries after a motorcycle accident approximately 60 years earlier. On examination, the patient was ventilated and there was no left-sided chest wall movement or breath sounds on auscultation. He was receiving aggressive fluid resuscitation and an adrenaline infusion to maintain blood pressure. The abdominal examination was unremarkable. Arterial blood gases showed a significant metabolic acidosis, with a pH of 6.8 and a lactate of 17. Plain chest radiography showed a gastric bubble and bowel loops in the thoracic cavity ( . Despite ongoing resuscitation, he did not improve and it was thought that the diaphragmatic herniation could have been the cause for his deterioration. Multiple attempts to pass a nasopharyngeal tube at this point were unsuccessful. Urgent computed tomography (CT) of the patient's chest and abdomen (Figs 2 and 3) revealed pancreas, large and small bowel in the thoracic cavity, suggesting a chronic diaphragmatic hernia. There was marked gastric dilatation and volvulus, with the pylorus remaining in the abdomen. There was uniform enhancement of the gastrointestinal tract with no ischaemic component. The left lung was entirely collapsed and there was some collapse of the right lung; in addition, there was midline shift of the heart. Operative intervention was considered at this point but the likely longstanding nature of his diaphragmatic herniation and his significant cardiac arrest precluded further intervention. Cardiorespiratory support was withdrawn and the patient died soon after.
