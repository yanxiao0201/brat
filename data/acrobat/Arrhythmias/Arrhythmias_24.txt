A 68-year-old man was admitted to our institution for treatment of atrial arrhythmias. He had a 4-year history of paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia, and had been treated with warfarin for one year prior to admission. On presentation, he complained of frequent episodes of palpitation. Transthoracic echocardiography revealed a large cystic mass connected to the left atrium next to the left atrial appendage (LAA). It also revealed moderate mitral regurgitation and a mildly enlarged left atrium. Multislice 3-dimensional computed tomography showed a very large aneurysm arising from just caudal to the LAA . The size of the aneurysm was 44 mm wide Â 43 mm deep Â 51 mm high. After a median sternotomy, the large LAA aneurysm was easily identified, and a similar but smaller aneurysm was found on the right atrial appendage . The LAA aneurysm was excised completely from the origin of the left atrium under cardioplegic arrest. There was no thrombus formation inside the aneurysm. Subsequently, we performed a Cox-maze IV procedure using a radiofrequency device and cryoablation, and mitral annuloplasty was undertaken using a posterior annuloplasty band. The right atrial appendage aneurysm was also excised during the maze procedure. The patient's postoperative course was uneventful. Postoperative computed tomography showed complete resection of the LAA aneurysm. Pathological study of both aneurysm specimens revealed extremely thin walls with no muscular structures . Microscopic examination demonstrated cystic lesions with hypertrophic myocardium and fibrosis on the both aneurysms. At 6 months post-surgery, the patient was doing well with no cardiac symptoms and normal sinus rhythm.
