A 64-year-old man with old anteroseptal myocardial infarction presented with electrical storm of ventricular tachycardia (VT). The QRS configuration during VT indicated right bundle branch (BB) block with a superior axis similar to that during sinus rhythm. The H-V interval during VT was 55 ms, which was shorter than that (70 ms) during sinus rhythm . The pace map at the left posterior fascicular (LPF) area with BB potential matched clinical VT . Entrainment pacing from the right ventricular apex indicated that BB reentrant VT was unlikely, and the diagnosis of interfascicular reentrant VT (IFRVT) was confirmed . During VT, radiofrequency ablation was applied to the left anterior fascicular area where BB potential was recorded during sinus rhythm to avoid complete atrioventricular block. VT was terminated in 1.5 s and was never observed afterwards. There are several reports on successful ablation of a retrograde limb of a IFRVT , but none in the setting of electrical storm . Ablation of a retrograde limb of IFRVT may be feasible in a case with limited antegrade conduction during sinus rhythm.Those QRS configurations were similar in both sinus rhythm and VT. Three-dimensional electroanatomical voltage map of the left ventricle during sinus rhythm in right anterior oblique view. A perfect pace map was obtained at the site of the left posterior fascicule area. Bundle branch potential was recorded at proximal left anterior fascicular area. In the right upper panel, a bundle branch potential was clearly observed.
