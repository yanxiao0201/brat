A 46-year-old male collapsed suddenly at his workplace and was brought in dead to a tertiary care hospital. A post-mortem was performed. The body was moderately built and obese. Post-mortem staining was present over the back and was fixed; generalised rigour mortis was present. No demonstrable external or internal injuries were noted at autopsy. The heart was enlarged, weighing 880 g  and the surface showed multiple areas of fibrosis (old healed infarcts) . The ventricular walls were thickened with the left ventricular wall showing areas of old healed infarcts. The thickness of the left ventricular wall was 2.2 cm  and that of the right ventricular wall 1.1 cm. On dissection of the coronary arteries, the left anterior descending artery was patent . The left circumflex artery and the right coronary artery were thickened and narrowed by 10% due to atheromatous plaque. The atrio-ventricular valve, semilunar valves and the papillary muscles were intact . The lungs were oedematous and congested. The stomach contained 50 mL of clear fluid, there was no unusual smell and the mucosa was normal. Other organs were intact and congested. Histo-pathological examination confirmed myocardial hypertrophy and old healed infarcts. No other pathology was detected. The toxicological screen of the viscera and blood was negative.
