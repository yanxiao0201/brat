A 14 year-old-male was referred to an academic tertiary care unit with an initial diagnosis of C7 compression fracture. His main complaints were neck pain and left hand weakness starting after a bicycle accident. However, the patient stated that his left hand was sluggish and he had some difficulty in grasping with left side over the last Preoperative imaging studies of the patient. Plain lateral radiograph demonstrates destruction and loss of height at C7 (a) Sagittal T1 (b) T2 (c) and axial T1 (d) weighted cervical magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies show the pathological compression fracture at C7 affecting the corpus and left pedicle, and the signal changes due to vascular abnormality; swelling and edema of the spinal cord at C5-6 levels, as well The pre-and perioperative pictures taken during the embolization process. Left anterior oblique projection angiogram of the left vertebral artery revealing the feeding branches that are coming from just distal part of the left vertebral artery origin as well as costocervical trunk (a). Left anterior oblique projection digital subtraction angiography (DSA), selective catheterization of costocervical trunk demonstrating an enlarged tortious feeding artery that is supplying the caudal portion of the AVM (better visualized compared to ). There is also another serpiginous arising more cranially from the left deep cervical artery (b). A different angle view of left anterior oblique projection DSA showing stasis of contrast material just after application of onyx to the nidus (c). Non-contrast lateral angiogram showing the onyx cast after the procedure (d) several months. The neurological examination revealed 1/5 motor strength deficit at intrinsic hand muscles on the left side and hyperesthesia at C8 and T1 dermatomes. Deep tendon reflexes were hyperactive, the toe was upgoing and there was ?? clonus on the left side at the time of admission.
