The proband was an 11-year-old girl, born in a twin pregnancy to non-consanguineous parents. The pregnancy and delivery were uncomplicated and her twin brother was normal. The birth weight was 900 gm and she exhibited severe signs of being small for her gestational age. The patient was referred for genetic counseling at the age of 11 due to her short stature (128 cm) and poor school performance. Her FSH level was 106.1 uU/mL, LH level was 21.38 uU/mL, UE level was 55.00 and the glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) level was 0,4u/g Hb. Her weight was 35.5 kg at the time of referral. She also exhibited dysmorphic features, such as a simian crease on both hands and clinodactly on the right hand. Furthermore, short and hypoplastic nails, low posterior hairline, downslanting eyes, hypertelorism, anteverted nares, a short-bridged nose, and long philtrum were observed. Early psychomotor development was reported as normal. Although overall learning disabilities and mild mental retardation were observed, further analysis for mental retardation was not performed due to the refusal of the patient. Abdominal ultrasound was performed and ovaries were not observed. Following a convulsion attack, she was treated with Depakine and Ritalin (methylphenidate HCl).
