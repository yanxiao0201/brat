A previously well 57-year-old-woman presented with several months of exertional dyspnoea and occasional irregular palpitations. Physical examination was notable for symmetrical pulses with a wide pulse pressure (BP=160/50), a displaced apical impulse, and a continuous murmur loudest in the second left intercostal space. Cardiac MRI demonstrated a patent ductus arteriosus connecting the proximal left pulmonary artery to the descending aorta, distal to the left subclavian artery ( , B, arrows and see online supplementary video 1). This was associated with significant left to right shunting (Qp:Qs=2.0), causing marked left ventricular enlargement ( , see online supplementary video 2) and a wide pulse pressure. The ductus measured 7 mm in diameter and 5â€“6 mm in length. Pulmonary artery systolic pressure was 30 mm Hg.
