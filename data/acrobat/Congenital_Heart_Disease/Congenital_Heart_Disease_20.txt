The current study was approved by the ethics committee of Changzheng Hospital, the Second Affiliated Hospital of The Second Military Medical University.
A 56-year-old man presenting with impeded defecation and claudication was admitted into our hospital. The patient had a history of smoking, but no history of hypertension, diabetes, pelvic surgery or trauma. Computed tomographic angiography (CTA) revealed an aneurysm-like lesion with a tortuous draining vein connected to the contralateral iliac vein. The right femoral artery was punctured and a 5-Fr sheath was placed, followed by a pigtail catheter, to the bifurcation of the abdominal aorta. Immediate arteriography revealed an early developed aneurysm-like lesion with a dilated draining vein connected to the inferior vena cava through the contralateral iliac vein ( and 1B). The anterior branch of the ipsilateral internal iliac artery (IIA) was confirmed as the feeding artery. The PDAO (XJFD1618, Lifetech, Shenzhen, China), assembled in vitro, was delivered to the target vessel through its corresponding delivery system (SFAQ8F, Lifetech) and detached at the proximate segment. Intraoperative imaging demonstrated total occlusion of the lesion, with the posterior branch of the ipsilateral IIA preserved . Limb ischemia had been permanently relieved. A CTA conducted at one-year follow-up indicated that the PDAO was in situ and there was no recanalization of the lesion .
