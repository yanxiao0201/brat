In our case, the patient again presented to hospital 2 weeks later with the acute onset of impaired gait and memory. The patient was deemed to be at high risk for recurrent paradoxical embolism, given the failure of medical therapy. The PFO was closed with a 25-mm Amplazer Cribriform device. After closure, the patient was maintained on aspirin 81 mg and rivaroxaban 20 mg daily. She has been symptom free since closure and was doing well at the 6-month follow-up visit.
