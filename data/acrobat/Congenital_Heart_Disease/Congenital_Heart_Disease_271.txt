A 55-year-old man presented with ICH in the right frontal area. Right carotid angiography showed an abnormal vascular staining lesion in the insular area during themidarterial phase and an early venous drainage of the sylvian vein with a dilated medullary vein during the capillary phase. The 3D reconstructed image revealed a caput medusa feature of the veins. GKS was performed to treat a vp-AVM. A follow-up angiogram obtained 24 months later showed a reduction of the vascular staining lesion and a decrease in early venous drainage .
A 27-year-old man visited a hospital due to a migraine headache with aura in the left temporal area. The brain MRI revealed multiple signal voids in the left posterior temporal lobe. Left vertebral angiography showed poorly marginated lesions of arterial blush and early venous drainage with a dilated medullary vein during the midarterial phase. The vp-AVM volume measured by MRI based on projections drawn from the angiography images was 5.2 ml, and the marginal dose was 18 Gy. A followup angiogram obtained 24 months after GKS showed a reduction of the extent of the arterial blush in the lesion and nearly the disappearance of the early venous drainage. Moreover, the patient's headache had improved .
