The patient was a 20-year-old man, right-handed, without any particular history. In April 2014, he experienced malaise followed by tonic-clonic movements and impaired consciousness. On admission, his Glasgow score was 4 and he showed bilateral myosis. A computed tomography (CT) scan revealed a deep intraparenchymatous hematoma in the left hemisphere, measuring 65 mm along its longest axis . An intracranial pressure monitor installed in Intensive Care showed high intracranial pressure (40 mm H 2 O). Arteriography showed a deep arteriovenous malformation (AVM) supplied by a lenticulostriate artery and draining into a left lateral ventricular vein . It was decided to evacuate the hematoma but, given the depth of the malformative nidus, it seemed wiser to perform endovascular occlusion of the AVM before the craniectomy.
