A 52-year-old woman was to undergo coil embolization for a non-ruptured left ICA paraclinoid (cave) aneurysm, 5 mm Â 6 mm. An Axcelguide 6F 80 cm STR (Medikit Co., Ltd, Tokyo, Japan) was inserted into the left ICA as a guiding sheath, and a Cerulean DD6 105 cm (Medikit Co., Ltd) was advanced to around the ICA siphon. An attempt was made to perform coil embolization using the balloon-assist technique, but the microcatheter was unstable. Next, a Cerulean G40 125 cm (Medikit Co., Ltd) was advanced to the aneurysmal neck coaxially. Coil embolization was started through a HeadWay 17 STR 2M (MicroVention Terumo, Tustin, CA, USA). After three 30-cm coils were used, a Cerulean G40 deviated into the ICA. After trying to insert into the neck of the aneurysm a RADIFOCUS 0.035 150 cm angle E type (Terumo, Tokyo, Japan) into the neck of the aneurysm, angiogram showed a CCF with visualization of the superior ophthalmic vein and contralateral cavernous sinus. There was no cortical venous reflux ( (a), (b)). Heparinization was reversed by protamine. A Scepter C 4 Â 10 mm (MicroVention Terumo) was inflated at the fistula to reduce blood flow, but the CCF thrombus did not progress. The combination of a HeadWay 17 STR/RADIFOCUS Guide Wire M 0.012 double angle (Terumo, Tokyo) was inserted into the fistula through a Cerulean DD6. Seven coils were used, for a total of 15 cm, under balloon-assist ( (a), (b)). After the shunt disappeared, aneurysmal coil embolization was resumed and finished to complete embolization .
