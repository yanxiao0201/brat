A 30-year-old man suffered brief acute neck pain 15 months before admission. He thereafter noticed intermittent shocklike sensations with neck flexion (the Lhermitte sign). He progressed to develop lower-extremity weakness followed by bowel incontinence and difficulty initiating micturition. Examination revealed the patient to have increased muscle tone and hyperreflexia, especially in the lower extremities. Imaging of the brain and cervical spine (Figs. 1 and 2) showed serpiginous flow voids within the posterior fossa and rostral cervical spine. DSA showed a posterior fossa dAVF fed by both posterior meningeal arteries . Preoperative embolization was performed through the right posterior meningeal artery. Embolization through the left posterior meningeal artery was unsuccessful because of vessel size and tortuosity. One day after embolization, a combined suboccipital, left far-lateral approach was taken to surgically interrupt the dAVF. Abnormal dilated vessels were immediately visualized after dural opening. ICG videoangiography performed at this point showed the draining vein, venous aneurysm, and dural feeders that were feeding the fistula through the dura . An aneurysm clip was placed at the junction between the venous aneurysm and feeders within the dura to obliterate the fistula. ICG videoangiography was repeated and showed no further drainage through the abnormal veins . Postoperative DSA  and MRI (Figs. 7 and 8) confirmed obliteration of the dAVF. The patient's postoperative hospital course was unremarkable. At follow-up examination, the patient reported that hisbowel and bladder functions were normalizing. His spasticity, however, had not improved significantly.
