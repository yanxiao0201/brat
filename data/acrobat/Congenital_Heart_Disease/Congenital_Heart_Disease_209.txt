A 52-year-old Caucasian female with new onset atrial fibrillation and a family history of premature sudden death underwent transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) to evaluate the presence of structural heart disease. A 12 lead baseline EKG demonstrated no evidence of an Epsilon wave nor repolarization abnormalities and there was no evidence of premature ventricular contractions nor ventricular tachycardia on 48 hour Holtor monitoring. TTE demonstrated abnormal thickening of the left ventricular (LV) apex with trabeculations and recesses, consistent with LVNC . The LV ejection fraction on TTE was >60%. Although the anterior mitral valve was structurally normal, the posterior mitral valve leaflet (PMVL) was thickened and embedded within the lateral trabeculated LV myocardium, resulting in severe mitral regurgitation. There was no evidence of pulmonary hypertension as the pulmonary artery systolic pressure was calculated at 30 mm Hg. CMR imaging confirmed the atypical appearance of LVNC extending from the LV apex to the basal portion of the LV with significant restriction of the PMVL ( : white arrows). Additionally, on CMR, although the RV cavity was not dilated, there was dyskinesis of the apical free wall of the RV with a RVEF calculated at 43% ( : black arrow). This appeared to be consistent with an atypical variant of LVNC. The patient was subsequently discharged home and is undergoing evaluation for implantable cardioverter defibrillator placement.
