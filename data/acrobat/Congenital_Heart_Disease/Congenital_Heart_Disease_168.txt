A 61-year-old, hypothyroid, dyslipidemic, nonsmoking, white man with no prior history of cardiovascular disease presented to the emergency department with 3 to 4 weeks of progressive exertional substernal chest pressure and associated dyspnea. Symptoms were most notable with lawn mowing and were relieved by rest. His initial electrocardiogram demonstrated right ventricular hypertrophy by voltage along with right axis deviation. Chest radiograph was inconspicuous. The chest pain was relieved with sublingual nitroglycerin. Heparin infusion was initiated, and the patient was admitted to the hospital with a diagnosis of unstable angina. Cardiac isoenzymes remained negative, and transthoracic echocardiogram was notable for mild right ventricular enlargement and mildly diminished right ventricular systolic function with normal estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure. Left ventricular size and function were within reference ranges, and there were no regional wall motion abnormalities; no valvular disease was evident. Myocardial perfusion study was recommended by the consulting cardiologist, and a regadenoson nuclear scan was performed that revealed a small reversible defect in the inferolateral wall. Quantified ejection fraction was 55% to 60%. The patient subsequently underwent coronary angiography, and the dominant right coronary artery (RCA) was found to be free of any significant coronary artery disease. There was great difficulty in selectively engaging the left coronary artery, necessitating an aortogram, which disclosed an anomalous origin arising near the right coronary cusp. Despite using conventional coronary catheters, less than ideal opacification of the vessel was achieved. No high-grade obstruction was observed, but a coronary computed tomography angiogram was requested for further clarifica
