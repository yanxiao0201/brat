An 18-year-old Pakistani woman presented to our emergency department with hematemesis of 6 hours' duration. She did not have any past medical history of GI bleeding, chronic liver disease, peptic ulcer disease or use of alcohol or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. She was taking no medications prior to this presentation and denied use of any herbal or dietary supplements. Her family history was significant for hypertension in her father. Her family had no history of liver disease, colon cancer or any other GI malignancy. Her physical examination was significant for tachycardia and lethargy. Her pulse rate was 122 beats/min, and her blood pressure was 100/60mmHg. Her respiratory rate was 18 breaths/min, and her body temperature was 37.6°C. She had no abdominal pain or any stigmata of chronic liver disease. A nasogastric aspirate was negative for blood. Her laboratory values were as follows: hemoglobin, 4g/dl (normal range, 12.3 to 15.3g/dl); mean corpuscular volume, 77.2 fl (normal range, 80.0 to 96.0 fl); white blood cell count, 9000/mm 3 (normal range, 4.8 to 10.8×10 4 mm 3 ); platelets, 238,000/μl (normal range, 145,000 to 445,000/μl); urea, 26mg/dl (normal range, 5 to 22mg/dl); creatinine, 0.8mg/dl (normal range, 0.6 to 1.3mg/dl); serum sodium, 136mmol/L (normal range, 134 to 142mmol/L); serum potassium, 3.2mmol/L (normal range, 3.5 to 5.0mmol/L); total bilirubin, 0.6mg/dl (normal range, 0.2 to 1.2mg/dl); aspartate transaminase, 32IU/L (normal range, 5 to 34IU/L); alanine transaminase, 40IU/L (normal range, 5 to 55 IU/L); alkaline phosphatase, 87IU/L (normal range, 42 to 140IU/L); international normalized ratio, 0.9 (normal range, 0.9 to 1.1); and prothrombin time, 12.9 seconds (normal range, 11.8 to 14.3 seconds). She was resuscitated with intravenous fluids and 4U of packed red blood cells. An esophagogastroduodenoscopy was performed, which revealed swelling in the first part of the duodenum . The initial appearance of the swelling suggested that it was an abnormally placed or accessory papilla. There was a small, <3-mm opening on the lesion that resembled the biliary or pancreatic orifice. On gentle manipulation with a catheter, blood spurted from the swelling area, and a vessel was visible (Figures 2 and 3). Adrenaline was used for hemostasis. After hemostasis was achieved, it became clear that the lesion was most consistent with a Dieulafoy's-like lesion and not a papilla. Band ligation was then performed , and the patient did not develop any complications and did not have any further episodes of bleeding. The patient was eventually discharged to home in stable condition. The patient was followed up for 6 months and did not have any other episodes of GI bleeding.
