A 29-year-old woman (G1P0) was referred to our tertiary maternal-fetal medicine center at 28 weeks of gestation because of vaginal spotting, placenta praevia, and a prenatal ultrasound (US) diagnosis of a fetal VGAM at 25 weeks gestation. The mother had no systemic symptoms, in particular no signs of dizziness, shortness of breath, chest pain, or contractions. She felt vigorous fetal movements. Her physical examination showed an intact, competent cervix and scant dark old blood in the vagina with no active bleeding.A transabdominal US showed a placenta praevia, mild cerebral ventriculomegaly, and a dilated and elongated vein of Galen with multiple dilated likely feeding adjacent vessels. Flow profiles revealed high velocity consistent with a VGAM . In addition, US showed cardiomegaly , dilated jugular veins , and ascites around the liver . A fetal MRI was performed the next day to evaluate the VGAM in better detail and to study possible focal or systemic/hemodynamic complications of the VGAM. The fetal MRI showed a markedly enlarged vein of Galen confirming the VGAM , severe dilatation of the dural venous sinuses and intracranial veins, moderate cerebral ventriculomegaly, and extensive, bilateral (right>left), periventricular white matter injury  which appeared partially hemorrhagic. In addition, the fetal MRI confirmed severe global cardiomegaly , marked dilatation of the jugular veins , fetal hydrops including ascites and subcutaneous edema , as well as moderate polyhydramnios. Finally, several important additional findings unrelated to the VGAM were noted: a three vessel umbilical cord was wrapped at least two times around the fetal neck , placenta praevia , and three large, partially degenerated uterine fibroids .
