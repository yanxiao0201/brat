This patient's clinical course was documented in our earlier report . Briefly, at the age of 1 year, he was referred to us due to recurrent vomiting. He presented at the pediatrics department with a depressed nasal bridge, low-set ears, thick lips with peg-shaped teeth, marked sweating deficiency, sparse hair, thin and atrophic skin, and scaly dermatitis with frontal bossing. A diagnosis of AED was made. His mother and his maternal grandfather also displayed peg-shaped teeth, a depressed nasal bridge, low-set ears, thick lips, sparse hair, thin atrophic skin, and hypohidrosis. Imaging studies revealed one large and two small heterogeneously enhanced posterior fossa masses with speckled calcifications and obstructive hydrocephalus . Histologically, surgical specimens revealed the classical features of DNMB. On pre-and post-operative images, including T2*-weighted images, there was no evidence of CVA. Postoperatively, we used a protocol consisting of four 21day cycles of induction chemotherapy, i.e., vincristine (VCR) 1.5 mg/m 2 /day (day 1), etoposide (VP-16) 100 mg/m 2 /day (days 1–5), cyclophosphamide (CPA) 1000 mg/m 2 /day (days 1, 3, 5), and cisplatin (CDDP) 20 mg/m 2 /day (days 1–5), and an intraspinal injection of methotrexate (MTX) 8 mg (day 1). Then, we delivered high-dose chemotherapy with L-PAM 90 mg/m 2 /day (days −3, −2), VP-16 200 mg/m 2 /day (days −7, −6, −5, −4), CBDCA 400 mg/m 2 /day (days −7, −6, −5, −4) followed by PBSCT (day 0). After 2 years, intracranial hemorrhage was detected at his regular radiological check-up. Preoperative imaging findings were suggestive of the development of Zabramski type 1 CVA . He was operated again, and this time histologic study confirmed CVA .
