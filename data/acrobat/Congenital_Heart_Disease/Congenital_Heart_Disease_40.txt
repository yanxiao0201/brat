A 69-year-old Caucasian female presented with a 2-year history of left forearm swelling. There was no history of trauma. She had a long-standing history of IgA nephropathy and consequently had two renal transplants. A left radial arteriovenous hemodialysis fistula had been created 20 years ago, but never used. On examination, there was a 7-cm palpable mobile, noncompressible and pulsatile mass on the anterior proximal aspect of the left forearm. The clinical diagnosis was an aneurysmal formation of the existing arteriovenous hemodialysis fistula. On ultrasound (US) , a heterogeneous hypoechoic mass was identified with ecogenic septa, and on Doppler ultrasound there was sparse central and peripheralvascularization. The fistula was identified next to the mass, and it had normal flow, without signs of aneurismatic complication. An MRI scan performed at our institution showed a 73 × 36 × 50-mm intermuscular mass in the anterior compartment of the left forearm, which contacted the flexor carpi radialis and the flexor digitorum superficialis muscles. The mass was heterogeneous on the T1-weighted image (T1WI; ) with areas of high signal intensity consistent with hemorrhage. On fat saturation sequences, there was no signal loss suggestive of the presence fat. T2WI  showed a heterogeneous hyperintense mass with peripheral focal low signal intensity areas. Postcontrast T1WI  showed peripheral nodular enhancement. Adjacent osseous and soft tissue structures were unremarkable. Considering the MRI appearance of a heterogeneous superficial mass with distinct hemorrhagic foci in various stages and peripheral enhancement, the differential diagnosis proposed was chronic hematoma (Morell-Lavallé), benign vascular proliferation and softtissue sarcoma. The patient underwent an ultrasound-guided biopsy with a 14-gauge needle. Two samples were obtained, which were diagnostic for IPEH . No severe bleeding after biopsy was observed.
