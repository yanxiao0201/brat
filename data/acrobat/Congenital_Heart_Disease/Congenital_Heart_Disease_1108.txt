Patient V:2 is the only surviving child from a triplet pregnancy. The other two triplets miscarried at 16 weeks gestation. This child was well at birth (no respiratory distress) but she presented with recurrent chest infections as a child and she currently has a wet productive cough and rhinitis. She does not have sinusitis. She has had grommets inserted for otitis media and is awaiting removal of her tonsils and adenoids. Situs inversus totalis was incidentally detected on chest X-ray. She has a structurally normal heart. She has some speech delay.
A fetal echocardiogram of patient V:3 showed that she had left atrial isomerism. Antenatal scans did not identify any other internal malformations. She was born prematurely at 26 + 3 weeks gestation following placental abruption and weighed 1.48 kg at birth. Apgar scores were one at 1 min and zero at 5 and 10 min. Full resuscitation, including cardiopulmonary resuscitation, was unsuccessful and she died. There was an antenatal diagnosis of a significant AVSD with hypoplastic right sided tissue. This lesion would not have been treatable unless the baby was born after 32 weeks gestation. She was also dysmorphic with low set ears and broad spaced nipples. Chromosome analysis showed a normal 46XX karyotype. Post mortem was not performed.
