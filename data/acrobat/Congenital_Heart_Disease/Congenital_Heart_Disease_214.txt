A 43-year-old woman was admitted with a one-month history of left-sided, stabbing headache. These severe headaches were resistant to simple analgesics and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and had presented 20-30 times a day, lasting five to ten minutes. The headache was accompanied by ipsilateral tearing and conjunctival hyperaemia, but no phonophobia, photophobia, nausea, or vomiting. There were no preceding symptoms like visual flickering or black spots. The patient had a history of lifting heavy objects just before the start of the headache attacks. Her medical and family histories were unremarkable. Neurological examination revealed transient left-sided sixth nerve palsy for a few days. Routine laboratory tests were unremarkable. Cranial MRI showed a subtle focal hyperintensity on T2 weighted (W) images, signal drop on T2W gradient echo images, and brush-like enhancement on post-gadolinium contrast T1W images . These findings were consistent with pontine CT . The patient was treated with high dose (150 mg/day) indomethacin. Due to the lack of a complete response, bilateral greater occipital nerve block with methyl prednisolone and lidocaine and left supraorbital nerve block with lidocaine was performed by one of the co-authors (IUC). At the follow-up visits, the patient reported an excellent response with no new attacks for more than eight months.
