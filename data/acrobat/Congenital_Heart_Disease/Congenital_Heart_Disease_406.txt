A 20-year-old woman presented to our outpatient orthopaedic surgery clinic with a one-year history of intermittent left leg pain. However, there was no history of antecedent trauma or illness. The past medical histories of the patient and her family were unremarkable. Results from laboratory tests were normal. Physical examination showed no other abnormalities such as discolouration, swelling, or bruising of the skin or soft tissue of her left leg. Figs. 1â€“4 show our imaging findings. No identifiable periosteal reaction, cortical thinning or soft tissue mass was noted in our patient. Based on the location of the lesion, the age of the patient and the imaging features observed, a fibrous tumour was the first clinical impression. Microscopic histological examination revealed intraosseous vascular proliferation composed of crowded blood vessels, replacing the marrow cavity, accompanied by a distorted vascular wall and abundant fibrous tissues . Masson's trichrome staining revealed the presence of elastic laminae and fibres . The histological features of this vascular anomaly in our patient are consistent with those of an intraosseous AVM. Our patient underwent resection of the intraosseous lesion and remained disease-free six months post operation.
