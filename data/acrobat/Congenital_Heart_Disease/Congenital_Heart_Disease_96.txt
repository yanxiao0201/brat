Case 1 A 23-year-old female patient with headaches underwent a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan that demonstrated a right thalamic DVA, without evidence of other vascular malformations ( b). Follow-up imaging 8 years later revealed a large CCM juxtaposed on the DVA identified on the prior imaging study . The patient experienced a symptomatic hemorrhage, rending her hemiparetic and necessitating resection. Pathological analysis identified a cavernous malformation. Follow-up MRI 3 years after resection demonstrated complete removal of the lesion but appearance of a CTG and further prominence of the DVA .
A 24-year-old female patient with sudden-onset sensory disturbances underwent MRI evaluation that revealed the presence of a CCM associated with a DVA in the pons . Interestingly, imaging also revealed evidence of a diffuse CTG associated with the DVA and the CCM . At the time of operative resection, the resection cavity was lined with CTGs , and pathological assessment of the resected lesion confirmed the presence of a cavernous malformation.
A 7-year-old male patient was evaluated after episodes of temporary right-arm weakness. MRI revealed a left thalamic CCM associated with a prominent DVA . The patient was treated with stereotactic radiosurgery at an outside institution. Imaging 16 months later demonstrated the appearance of flow voids juxtaposed over the CCM and persistence of the DVA . Cerebral angiography demonstrated the transformation of the CCM into an AVM . The patient has not yet undergone resection of the AVM.
