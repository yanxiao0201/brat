An 18-year-old woman was referred for surgical repair of a 24mm Secundum ASD with deficient rims. A central venous catheter was inserted via the right internal jugular vein. The heart was approached by median sternotomy, and cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) was then established by aortic and bicaval cannulation. The ASD was closed with a patch of autologous pericardium. The operative field was flooded with carbon dioxide during the procedure. The ascending aorta was vented throughout the procedure via the aortic cardioplegia cannula. Following the repair of the defect, de-airing of the heart was done with lungs ventilated, and TEE was used to ensure completely air-free heart chambers. The aortic cross clamp was then released. On weaning from CPB, the patient went into ventricular fibrillation. Direct current cardioversion was performed. On TEE, air bubbles were seen in the left atrium. Cardiopulmonary bypass was reinstituted and further de-airing maneuvers, such as aspiration with a 23-gauge needle and 10-cm 3 syringe from the aortic root, roof, and appendage of the left atrium and the left ventricular apex, were carried out to make heart chambers completely free of air. While on CPB with positive pressure ventilation, no further evidence of intracardiac air was observed. But as soon as discontinuation of bypass was
