in preparation for a vascular repair with left carotidsubclavian bypass. The CTA demonstrated a right-sided aortic arch with aberrant left SCA arising from a diverticulum of Kommerell  and coursing behind the trachea/ esophagus. There was narrowing of the mid-trachea and significant compression of the posterior esophagus caused by the left SCA at the thoracic inlet . There were five supra-aortic branches originating directly from the right arch . The first branch was a common trunk giving off the left common carotid artery and one of two proximal left VAs. The second branch was the right common carotid artery. The third branch was a fenestrated right VA. The fourth branch was the right SCA. The fifth branch was the aberrant left SCA with a diverticulum of Kommerell that gave rise to the second left VA. On the left, two VAs with separate origins and distal fusion were seen, thus constituting ''duplication.'' The one originating from the left SCA ascended in the prevertebral space and entered the left C5 transverse foramen. The second left VA originated from the left common carotid artery, ascended in the carotid space, and entered the left C4 transverse foramen, where it fused with the intraforaminal VA. On the right, the VA arose directly from the aortic arch and divided into two trunks near the origin, thus constituting a ''fenestration'' . The dominant VA entered the right C4 transverse foramen. The fenestrated VA ascended in the retropharyngeal space, and merged with the intraforaminal VA as it entered the transverse foramen at the level of C3 .
