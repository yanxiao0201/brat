The system was trailed in the second-stage resection of a left frontal AVM (Spetzler and Martin Classification 3B) in an 18-year-old male. This young man who had previously, just a few weeks before, undergone a Stage 1 skeletonization and incomplete resection of a 3.5-cm AVM located in the left supplementary motor region, required intra-operative AR visualization to aid in locating a couple of deep feeding arteries. It was important to localize these vessels early in the resection in order to expedite the surgery and potentially minimize blood loss.
