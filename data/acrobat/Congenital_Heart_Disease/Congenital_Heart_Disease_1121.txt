Patient 1. The proband was an 18 year old boy (Figs. 1a, b, c and 2a (individual II:2)) who at the time of the first evaluation was 16. On examination we found severe pectus excavatum, scoliosis and a Marfan facial appearance (malar hypoplasia, enophthalmos, retrognathia), as well as elongated face, high arched palate and crowded teeth. The proportion of segments was normal and he was of normal height (25 th –50 th centile), had no cardiac symptoms He has remained asymptomatic with no chest pain, syncope, or heart murmurs. No abnormalities were detected on electrocardiograma or echocardiogram. Ocular examination was normal, specifically lens placement was normal and there was no evidence of myopia. Computed Tomography (CT) imaging found there was no evidence of dural ectasia or protusio acetabulae. Annual evaluations since that time have failed to detect any cardiovascular, ocular or systemic involvement. The proband did not fulfill criteria for MFS or related disorders, since he presented one major and two minor criteria of the skeletal system according to Ghent criteria, with a total of 3 points for the score in the revised Ghent Criteria10–11. We then evaluated the rest of the family members. Patient 2. The proband's sister (Figs. 1c and 2a (Individual II:3)), a 16 year old girl was diagnosed with moderate pectus excavatum at 14 years of age. She also had some Marfanoid facial features (enophthalmos, retrognathia and malar hypoplasia). Height was normal (50th–75th centile). She currently has no cardiovascular or ocular abnormalities. According to Ghent criteria the patient had two minor skeletal criteria and 2 points for the revised score. Clinical examination of the proband's mother ( , individual I:2) and brother ( , individual II:1) did not show any skeletal or marfanoid features. Unfortunatelythe father ( , individual I:1) was not available for clinical evaluation or sample collection.
