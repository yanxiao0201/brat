A 41-year old woman visited an otolaryngologist with progressive hoarseness and mild shortness of breath. Clinical examination showed central cyanosis, plethora and clubbing. The patient's medical history is remarkable for patent ductus arteriosus and congenital ventricular septal defect with Eisenmenger's syndrome, treated conservatively due to perfect exercise capacity. During fiberoptic laryngoscopy, a left vocal cord paralysis was observed. Further examination by CT scan revealed a dramatically dilated pulmonary trunk and artery with a maximal diameter of 50 mm . This abnormality explained the patient's vocal cord palsy since there is compression of the left recurrent laryngeal nerve by the dilated pulmonary artery, better known as Ortner's syndrome. The combination of two congenital heart diseases in this case caused a left-to-right shunt with evolution to pulmonary hypertension and Eisenmenger's syndrome. The progressive nature of the disease caused severe dilatation of the pulmonary artery. After confirmation with right heart catheterisation, maximal treatment for pulmonary hypertension was started with sildenafil 20 mg t.i.d. and ambrisentan 5 mg q.d.
