History and Examination A 14-year-old boy with a history of SCD and a left MCA territory stroke at 4 years of age (resulting in right hemiparesis, speech changes, and seizures) presented with new-onset left hemiparesis. At the time of presentation, he was being treated with serial blood transfusions and antiepileptic drugs (AEDs). MRI of the brain showed a porencephalic region in the left frontal region and late post-ischemic changes in the watershed area in the right hemisphere. An angiogram showed complete obliteration of the right supraclinoid internal carotid artery (ICA) and stenosis of the left supraclinoid ICA with very poor recruitment from the external circulation and active recruitment from the posterior cerebral vessels, leading to the diagnosis of Suzuki Stage 3 moyamoya syndrome. Although it was not appreciated initially, a direct pAVF arising from a right MCA lenticulostriate artery and draining in a periventricular vein draining toward the internal cerebral vein was visible as shown on MRI ( â€“C) and angiography . These findings, although not initially evident, were identified when the imaging studies were re-evaluated after the patient presented with the symptomatic pAVF varix hemorrhage.
