The patient was a 33-year-old man with headache, left hemiparesis, hemihypesthesia and partial seizures of the left arm for a week. No personal or familial significant history was present. Computed tomography (CT) followed by magnetic resonance (MR) ( (a)–(f)) demonstrated a nodular lesion in the right frontal subcortical region, surrounded by an area suggestive of hematoma in the late subacute stage and by hyperintense perilesional edema on T1-weighted imaging (T1WI). The differential diagnosis was between cavernoma and hemorrhagic metastasis. The patient underwent excision of the lesion and evacuation of the hematoma. Pathology revealed cerebral hemorrhagic cavernous malformation (CCM).
The patient was a 25-year-old man with a history of treated cutaneous melanoma, without known metastases or recurrence for two years of follow-up. He presented with dysarthria and right arm paresthesias. CT and MR demonstrated a focal lesion in the left frontal subcortical region surrounded by hyperintense signal on T1WI ( (a)–(f)). Based on the medical history, it was assumed to be a metastatic melanoma and was subsequently excised. No hemorrhagic landmarks were present on the pathologic examination.
The patient was a 45-year-old man with a five-year previous history of cutaneous melanoma and pulmonary metastasis. On screening MR a small cerebral metastasis in the left frontal lobe was observed and the patient underwent surgery, without neurological sequela. MR carried out six months later showed recurrence. Peripheral hyperintense edema on T1WI can be seen ( (a)–(i)).
