A 7-month-old girl was admitted to the hospital with a history of lower respiratory tract infection. The child was born fullterm via cesarean section. There was no history of consanguineous marriage. The child had a history of congenital heart disease but an uneventful neonatal period. On clinical examination, she had mild cyanosis and clubbing, which were exacerbated with crying. Clinical cardiac examination revealed ejection systolic murmur with a single S2. There was delay in developmental milestones. The rest of the examination was normal. Echocardiography revealed an unbalanced atrioventricular canal defect, double outlet left ventricle, pulmonary stenosis, mild aortic valve regurgitation and small patent ductus. The right pulmonary artery was not visualized. Bilateral superior vena cavae were also observed. Chest radiograph revealed dextrocardia with normal pulmonary vasculature. The liver appeared midline. Hence, the diagnosis of heterotaxy syndrome was considered. MDCT examination confirmed dextrocardia with right-side aortic arch. There was moderate pulmonary stenosis with a relatively hypoplastic right pulmonary artery. Large confluent atrioventricular septal defects were noted. The liver was midline and the spleen was absent. Additionally, the trachea demonstrated division into four bronchi, all arising at carina. Both upper lobe bronchi arose very close to the point of division of lower lobe bronchi (carina). Pulmonary arteries were below the level of tracheal division. Tracheobronchial anatomy was explicitly displayed on minimal intensity projection and volume rendered views  and supplemented by endoscopic view of the trachea . Both lungs showed three lobes and a longitudinal furrow at superior-lateral aspect. Lung parenchyma was unremarkable. There were no anomalous vessels from the systemic or pulmonary circulation.
