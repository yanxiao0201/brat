A 77-year-old Caucasian man was admitted to our department, complaining of two episodes of massive oral hemorrhage during meals, accompanied by odynophagia and fever. Thirty-five days before, in another hospital, our patient had undergone total laryngectomy and bilateral selective neck dissection after failure of organsparing salvage radiochemotherapy (cisplatin 100mg/m 2 every 21 days for three cycles, and standard radiotherapy: 70Gy, 1.8Gy/day). The postoperative period was complicated by a small pharyngocutaneous fistula, which resolved in a few days with compressive bandages. Videoendoscopy demonstrated the presence of a large clot at the base of his tongue. A neck computed tomography (CT) scan (Figs. 1 and 2) revealed a pharyngojugular fistula with the presence of air in the left internal jugular vein (IJV). Our patient was subjected to an emergency operation consisting in cervicotomy, ligation and section of the left IJV and closure of the fistula using a pectoralis major myocutaneous flap. The postoperative period was uneventful. Twenty-five days post surgery, videofluorography was performed,which showed the fistula had disappeared. Our patient began oral feeding and was discharged. At present, 5 years after the operation, our patient is alive and shows no evidence of disease.
