Pair 1 ( Mother A 54-year-old woman presented with substernal chest pain and left arm discomfort. An electrocardiographic (ECG) recording revealed ST-elevation in the precordial leads. Emergent coronary angiography revealed a spiral dissection of the proximal left anterior descending artery (LAD) and absence of atherosclerotic disease. Attempted percutaneous revascularization was unsuccessful, so she underwent emergency coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery with left internal mammary artery (LIMA) to LAD. Her cardiovascular risk factors included current smoking, hypertension, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. She also had a history of anxiety and depression. Daughter A 42-year-old woman presented with left-sided chest and axillary pain along with elevated troponin levels and ECG changes consistent with nonâ€“ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). Coronary angiography revealed a spontaneous midLAD dissection, and she underwent CABG with LIMA to LAD. Her only cardiovascular risk factor was smoking. She reported a history of anxiety and depression. Fatal myocardial infarction was reported in 3 additional family members including a 62-year-old maternal grandmother, 62year-old maternal great-grandmother, and 42-year-old maternal grandaunt. None of the relatives had an autopsy.
