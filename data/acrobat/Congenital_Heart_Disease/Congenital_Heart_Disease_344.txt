We used a hospital database to identify all cases of ALCAPA repaired at our institution since 1994. Patients with ALCARPA were identified from the operative reports, and data were collected from electronic and paper medical records. Data included electrocardiogram, echocardiogram, and laboratory results as well as clinical information from the pre-and postoperative periods. Outside cardiologists were contacted to determine the status of the patients (living, transplanted, or dead) and to provide any postoperative echocardiograms. This study was approved by the Columbia University Medical Center Institutional Review Board.
