A 10-year-old Japanese boy with the Fallot tetralogy (ventricular septal defect, branch pulmonary artery stenosis, right ventricular hypertrophy, and aortic overriding), congenital scoliosis affecting the eighth thoracic hemivertebra, unilateral renal anomaly of the right kidney, limb anomalies and dislocation of the right knee, and choroidal coloboma was referred to our institution. On the basis of four out of seven component features, the patient was diagnosed as having the VACTERL association by a board-certified pediatrician. The patient was born by vaginal delivery following a gestation period of 37 weeks and weighed 2,740 g at birth. He underwent heart surgery using a Rastelli procedure when he was 2 years of age. Since then, he has led a normal life apart from the abstinence of vigorous exercise. The parent's family histories were unremarkable. There was no maternal or paternal history of congenital malformations, hypertension, diabetes, miscarriage, or consanguineous marriage.
