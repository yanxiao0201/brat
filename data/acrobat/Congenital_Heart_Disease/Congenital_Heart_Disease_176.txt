A 55-year-old man with a remote history of a gunshot wound to the left thigh 20 years ago presented to our clinic with a 1-year history of worsening dyspnea, left lower extremity pain, and swelling. Diagnostic evaluation included a computed tomographic angiography (CTA) which demonstrated a fistulous communication between the left superficial femoral artery (SFA) and the vein (SFV) as well as a 7.2-cm external iliac vein aneurysm ( D). Echocardiogram revealed a normal ejection fraction and significant biatrial enlargement consistent with high-output cardiac failure secondary to the arteriovenous fistula (AVF). Given the patient's symptomatology, an endovascular repair of his AVF was recommended, followed by antithrombotic therapy for his aneurysm. The left SFA was catheterized from a contralateral femoral approach. Initial arteriogram localized the presence of an AVF in the proximal-to-mid left SFA with early filling of the left femoral and iliac venous system and minimal distal arterial flow . An 11 mm Ã‚ 5 cm self-expanding covered stent (Viabahn; W.L. Gore, Flagstaff, Arizona) was placed in the proximal left SFA in order to exclude the fistula. Completion arteriogram demonstrated successful exclusion of the AVF without intraoperative hemodynamic derangements . The patient was maintained on oral anticoagulation and antiplatelet therapy. At the time of discharge, the patient reported immediate symptomatic improvement. Early postoperative imaging confirmed resolution of fistulous communication, absence of venous filling, and decrease in maximal left iliac vein aneurysm diameter. One-month follow-up duplex demonstrated a patent left proximal SFA stent and an isolated, nonocclusive deep venous thrombosis in the left proximal SFV. At 3-month follow-up, the patient denied further lower extremity swelling, pain, or shortness of breath. The CTA demonstrated a significant decrease in maximal diameter of the
