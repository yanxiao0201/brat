Patient history A 32-year-old nulliparous woman (Body Mass Index 27.0) was referred to the Kinderwunsch Zentrum Linz for ICSI treatment. She had been attempting pregnancy for 2.5 years. Her basal hormonal parameters of AMH, LH, and FSH were 4.05 ng/ml, 2.69 mU/ml, and 5.3 mU/ml, respectively. She regularly ovulated in a 28-day cycle (4 days of bleeding). An ultrasound examination revealed that she had a normal uterine cavity and ovaries as well as patent fallopian tubes. Like her partner she was sero-negative for hepatitis B and C, HIV and syphilis. Her husband (32 years of age) was aware of his situs inversus; however, it took until the age of 27 when he was diagnosed with Kartagener syndrome because of his chronic sinusitis and the associated respiratory distress. Thereafter, the adipose man (BMI of 31.7) consulted an andrologist where he was confronted with severe oligoasthenoteratozoospermia (2.6Ã—10 6 /ml, no motility, no morphological normal sperm) according to the WHO . Hormonal examination further revealed hypotestosteronemia (116 ng/dl) which was treated with a testosterone gel (25 mg, every second day).
