A 24-year-old woman developed occipital headache. She was diagnosed as having 22q11.2DS on genetic testing at 7 years of age. Her medical history was comprised of a tetralogy of Fallot and a congenital defect of the right carotid artery. She had been attending the department of psychiatry for schizophreniform psychosis for a long time. On examination, she presented with headache and anxiety. No abnormality was found on neurologic examination except for mild mental retardation. Brain MRI data showed linear high-intensity lesions on T2-weighted imaging and low-intensity lesions on T1weighted imaging in the outer margin of the thalamus adjacent to the internal capsule (i.e., thalamic reticular nucleus, bilaterally) . SPECT with Tc-99m ECD revealed hypoperfusion in the bilateral thalamus . She was diagnosed as having a tension-type headache.
