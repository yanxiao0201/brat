A 57-year-old male hypertensive Caucasian patient who was on medical treatment for 1.5 months for non-organic AF was admitted to the ICU because of high-ventricular response AF (170 per minute), and sinus rhythm was maintained during the CV that was performed two times every second day. The results of the apnea test performed in the ICU on the same night after the second CV were as follows: apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) of 71 per hour, minimum peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 67%, and desaturation period (SpO2 of less than 90%) of 28 minutes. The patient was discharged with medical treatment and nocturnal BiPAP treatment. 
Case 2
A 33-year-old healthy male presented to the emergency department after falling from a bicycle while riding intoxicated. The patient was wearing a helmet but sustained unilateral lacerations and a zygomaticomaxillary complex fracture with an orbital floor fracture. Examination of extraocular motility revealed a-2 restriction in upgaze in the affected eye, and a continuous cardiac monitor revealed a reproducible decrease in heart rate from a baseline pulse of 65–70 to a pulse as low as 42–45 with attempted upgaze. The bradycardia would promptly resolve after return to primary gaze, and the degree of bradycardia would also diminish with sustained upgaze to around 50 beats per minute after approximately 20 seconds. The patient did not endorse syncopal symptoms during the bradycardia, but he did have 3 witnessed episodes of vomiting, while in the emergency department. The rest of the eye exam was unremarkable. It was felt initially that the bradycardia was related to inferior rectus muscle entrapment. However, a CT of the head/orbits demonstrated no prolapse of the inferior rectus but instead evidence of a small amount of soft tissue, which likely represented adventitia surrounding the inferior rectus trapped in and below the orbital floor fracture. The orbital floor bones were also non-displaced with only a linear fracture, consistent with a trapdoor fracture. 
Case 3
A 74-year-old man who had drug-refractory paroxys-mal atrial flutter 2 years after circumferential pulmonary venous isolation was referred to our hospital. During repeated ablation, clinical arrhythmia was induced. Mapping of the left atrium revealed the entire tachycardia cycle length. Capturing fractionated bipolar electrograms at anterolateral left atrial (LA) wall demonstrated concealed entrainment with postpacing interval comparable with tachycardia cycle length. During linear ablation from mitral annulus along fractionated electrograms to the scar near left superior pulmonary vein using an irrigated tip catheter (power, 35 W; temperature, 40 oC), atrial flutter terminated, which was followed by sinus nodal (SN) arrest requiring urgent temporary pacing. There was no recovery of SN function after 3 days, and a permanent pacemaker was implanted. A review of cardiac computed tomography (CT) before abla-tion revealed a small blood vessel originating from the left circumflex artery, running along the anterior LA wall to reach the cavoatrial junction of the right atrium, which was not seen in postablation CT. A 3-dimensional reconstruction image showed that this was a left-sided SN artery.
