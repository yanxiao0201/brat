A 62-year-old male presented with progressive dyspnoea for 10 days. He had a background of stage IV metastatic non-small lung carcinoma treated for 6 months with non-cardiotoxic chemotherapy (carboplatin and gemcitabine), and recently commenced on target therapy (Erlotinib). Clinical examination revealed signs consistent with cardiac tamponade, including significant pulsus paradoxus, tachycardia (heart rate 101), tachypnea (respiratory rate 25), elevated jugular venous pressure and muffled heart sounds. He was normotensive at 130/90mmHg. The patient was extremely anxious and spontaneously expressed concern about his imminent death. His electrocardiogram (ECG)  demonstrated electrical alternans and bedside transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) revealed a large pericardial effusion with features of cardiac tamponade, including diastolic compression of both right atrium and ventricle ( , Additional file 1: Video 1 and Additional file 2: Video 2) and large mitral inflow variation . Urgent pericardiocentesis was performed with a restricted aspiration of only 600 ml drained initially over the first hour, and a total drainage of 1.8 l of heavily blood-stained pericardial fluid over 36 h. During initial aspiration of pericardial fluid there was immediate symptomatic relief and haemodynamic improvement (heart rate decreased to 80/min, respiratory rate
