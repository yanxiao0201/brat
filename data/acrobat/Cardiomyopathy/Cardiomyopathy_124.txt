A 69-year-old woman with a history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and sick sinus syndrome with a dual-chamber pacemaker was admitted to our institution with Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia. She exhibited nonspecific neurological complaints, and head CT demonstrated multiple cerebral lesions consistent with septic emboli. Transesophageal echocardiography revealed a 3-cm vegetation on the right atrial pacemaker lead ( , Video I in the Data Supplement). There was no evidence of aortic or mitral valve endocarditis; however, a patent foramen ovale with intermittent rightto-left shunting was identified ( and 1C, Video II in the Data Supplement). Surgical removal was considered; however, the potential for hemorrhagic conversion of recent embolic strokes from high-dose heparin needed during cardiopulmonary bypass was prohibitive. Transvenous lead extraction was used and, to protect the cerebral circulation from further embolization, several Cordis Angioguard (Cordis, Miami, FL) devices were deployed to the cerebral circulation before lead extraction . Anticoagulation with 5000 U of heparin was administered for a brief period during Angioguard deployment. Both leads were successfully removed with a combination of powered and mechanical extraction sheaths. Postoperatively, the patient recovered to her baseline mental status with no imaging evidence of additional cerebral embolization.
