A 56-year-old male had recurrent episodes of self-limiting fever for several months, but was not immunocompromised nor was he a drug abuser. He had received antibiotic treatment during his first visit to an outside hospital, and CCTA revealed a mildly enhancing soft tissue mass adjacent to the aortic root. Due to suspicion of para-aortic neoplasm, such as lymphoma, he was referred to our institution for further evaluation. Upon arrival, he was febrile with mild chest pain and unremarkable physical examination. Laboratory tests revealed leukocytosis, but blood culture, cardiac serum markers and serum tumor markers were all negative. A transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) was performed to differentiate possible para-aortic neoplasm or culture negative peri-aortic infectious process. TEE revealed vegetations with thickening of the left and non-coronary cusps and fistulous communication between the LVOT and aortic root ( and supplementary movie S1). Subsequent MRI revealed fluid-containing cavity lesion, fistulous connection to the LVOT (supplementarymovie S2) and a prominent ring-like enhancement along the wall  with possible intra-cavity thrombus. The findings corresponded with a moderate heterogenous and ring-like uptake of FDG tracer from PET/CT. The combined multimodality imaging findings all supported the diagnosis of aortic root abscess over para-aortic neoplasm. Patient started on empiric antibiotics, and open thoracotomy surgery for excision of infectious tissue, fistula repair and valvular replacement confirmed the image findings. Patient recovered uneventfully after the operation and was discharged for regular follow-up.
