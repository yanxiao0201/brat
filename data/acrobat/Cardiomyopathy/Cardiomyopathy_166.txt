After an extensive literature review and discussion with several national toxicologists, we determined that this was a documented effect of exposure to aluminum phosphide pesticides. This was also supported by review of the patient' s admission laboratory values, which demonstrated a metabolic acidosis (bicarbonate 15 mEq/L) and mild hyperglycemia (glucose 147 mg/dL), both of which quickly resolved on subsequent testing. To ensure this was not a coincidental finding of cardiomyopathy of another cause, a cardiomyopathy evaluation was undertaken. Acute viral titers, including herpes simplex virus, Epstein-Barr virus, echovirus, cytomegalovirus, coxsackievirus, and adenovirus, as well as convalescent titers obtained 20 days later, were negative with the exception of a positive mumps immunoglobulin G, thus indicating an appropriate immune response to vaccines without any additional evidence of acute infection. The patient' s erythrocyte sedimentation rate at diagnosis was normal (8 mm/hr). C-reactive protein was only mildly elevated (Electrocardiogram obtained at initial cardiology evaluation demonstrating sinus tachycardia, left axis deviation, poor R-wave progressive, and diffuse T-wave flattening.Phosphide exposure is known to rapidly affect multiple organ systems including the respiratory, cardiovascular, hepatic, renal, hematologic, and gastrointestinal systems. Early symptoms of acute exposure can vary on the exposure route and dose, but typically include fatigue, dyspnea, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, hypotension, and tachycardia. 11â€“13 Progression of illness can be rapid and may lead to organ failure of any of the
