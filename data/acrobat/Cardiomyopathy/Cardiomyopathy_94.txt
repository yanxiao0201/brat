Our case involves a healthy 70-year-old woman without any cardiovascular risk factors. She had no chronic illnesses and received no medications. Approximately 3 h after a stressful event, the death of her cat, she complained of chest pain and nausea. Her relatives called her physician, who noted a blood pressure of 122/70 mmHg and heart rate of 95 bpm. Her symptoms increasingly worsened over the next few minutes. She was transported to the emergency department of a hospital about 45 min after the first onset of symptoms. Although cardiopulmonary resuscitation was started upon arrival, she had already died. However, it should be noted that the time interval between the stressful event and the onset of the symptoms may not be accurate, due to general confusion during the event and the fact that the woman lived alone.
