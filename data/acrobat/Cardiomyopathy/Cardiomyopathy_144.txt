A 74-year-old man with dilated cardiomyopathy, New York Heart Association Class III, had an implantable cardioverter defibrillator placed in 2008 for primary prophylaxis of sudden cardiac death. In January 2015, the patient presented with worsening heart failure and a markedly decreased ejection fraction (left ventricular ejection fraction 20%). Bradyarrhythmia (<40/min) resulted in dyssynchronous right ventricular apical pacing ≥95%. Decision to upgrade the patient's system to a cardiac resynchronization therapy system (St Jude Medical, PROMOTE CD3211-36, St Paul, MN) was made in line with current guidelines. 1 The venogramm revealed a huge CS with only one suitable lateral side branch with a 110° angle and a kinking at 1.5 cm followed by a distribution into 2 smaller branches . A quadripolar lead (St Jude Medical Quartet, St Paul, MN) became immediately dislodged. After changing the lead to a bipolar lead (St Jude Medical Quickflex μ 1258T, St Paul, MN), the proximal portion of the target branch was reached with good sensing and pacing values and no phrenic nerve capture, but dislodgement occurred again. However, despite the use of a stiff wire and an additional buddy wire (Galeo Pro; Biotronik, Berlin, Germany), the lead could not be further advanced to establish a stable position. We decided to introduce a 3.00×12 mm bioresorbable scaffold (Abbott, Absorb, North Chicago, IL) via a second simultaneous CS catheter (St Jude Medical CPS 115, St Paul, MN) into the proximal portion of the side branch in an attempt to stabilize the lead against the side of the vessel and prevent its dislodgement. The scaffold was positioned directly proximally to the second electrode. The balloon was inflated for 60 s at 14 atm . Afterward, the final position showed a capture threshold of 1.0 V, pulse width of 0.5 ms, impedance of 890 Ω, and R-wave sensing of 7.7 mV . A 30-day follow-up showed stable measurements with improved heart failure symptoms.
