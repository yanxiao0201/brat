A 69-year-old woman with a history of hyperlipidemia and recently diagnosed paroxysmal atrial fibrillation presented with worsening shortness of breath over the past 6 months despite medical and ablation therapy. She experienced associated generalized weakness and fatigue with an incremental decline in her baseline functional status whereby minimal exertion elicited symptoms. On presentation, her vital signs were stable and physical exam was remarkable for jugular venous distention (JVD). The rest of her examination was unremarkable. Electrocardiogram (EKG) was notable for low voltage, atrial fibrillation and left anterior fascicular block. On chest X-ray, there was a moderate-sized right-sided pleural effusion. Echocardiogram demonstrated preserved left ventricular systolic function and left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH). Cardiac-MR imaging demonstrated diffuse heterogeneous enhancement of thickened endocardial myocardium on late gadolinium enhancement images consistent with cardiac amyloidosis . Right ventricular biopsy was negative for amyloid deposition by congo red stain under polarized light microscope; however, it showed random, non-branching fibrils ranging in size, from 8 to 10 mm in diameter consistent with amyloid deposition under the electronic microscope .!

Prior to her completion of the treatment she unfortunately passed from sudden cardiac death.
