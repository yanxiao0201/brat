On echocardiography, the patient was found to have a severely depressed left ventricular function with an ejection fraction of 20% and a structurally normal heart. Acute myocarditis was suspected, and subsequent cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMRI) confirmed the diagnosis. The CMRI revealed cardiomegalyAUTHOR DISCLOSURE Drs Perez, Kumar, Figueroa, Johnson, and Absi have disclosed no financial relationships relevant to this article.

A viral panel revealed elevated antibody titers to coxsackievirus. Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) was administered after confirmation of the diagnosis. She was also prescribed a milrinone intravenous drip and diuretic medications for her congestive failure. After this, she had gradual clinical improvement, with improving cardiac function indicated by serial echocardiography. She was subsequently extubated and had a smooth recovery. She remained hypertensive, which was attributed to her underlying kidney disease. Renal ultrasonography revealed bilateral small kidneys for age with some increased echogenicity. After consultation with a nephrologist, she was discharged with antihypertensive medications that include prazosin, enalapril, and carvedilol. Her echocardiogram before discharge showed an ejection fraction close to 40%.
