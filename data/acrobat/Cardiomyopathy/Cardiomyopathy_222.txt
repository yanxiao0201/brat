A 28-year-old man presented to the Emergency Department of the Clinical Center of Serbia, Belgrade, with fever of 39.9 ° C, facial/ neck edema, erythematous rash, cervical lymphadenopathy, malaise and shortness of breath that had commenced 24 h previously. He was tachycardic with a gallop rhythm, had dull heart sounds, and was tachypneic (20/min) and hypotensive (60/10 mm Hg).
The autopsy revealed EM with prominent interstitial edema and inflammatory infiltrate composed of eosinophils and mononuclear cells ( a, b). Vascular congestion of alveolar wall capillaries and alveolar damage were present ( c). Eosinophilic infiltrates were found in the stomach and skeletal muscles, while massive hemophagocytosis was observed in bone marrow and lymph nodes ( d). Acute heart failure caused by EM followed by pulmonary edema was established as the cause of death. The diagnosis of DIHS was confirmed by the first 5 of the following 6 diagnostic criteria: (i) a maculopapular rash developing 2–6 weeks after starting new therapy, (ii) lymphadenopathy, (iii) fever (>38 ° C), (iv) leukocytosis >10 × 10 9 /l (without atypical lymphocytes and eosinophilia but with prominent tissue eosinophilia), (v) hepatitis (alanine aminotransferase, ALT >100 U/ml) and (vi) human herpes virus 6 reactivation (not tested) . Genetic testing results, which were received postmortem, showed two heterozygous mutations in the gene for mevalonate kinase in exone 11 (C.1129G>A leading to P.V377I) and exone 6 (C.564.G>A leading to P.W188X) localized on 12q24.11, thus confirming hyper-IgD syndrome as one of the genetically defined hereditary periodic fever syndromes.
