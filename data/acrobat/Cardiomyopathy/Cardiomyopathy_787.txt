The following seven patients had an ARE procedure performed between October 2011 and April 2013 due to small annular size during AVR: Case 1 patient. A 79-year-old female who presented with significant shortness of breath, flash pulmonary edema, severe aortic stenosis, ventricular hypertrophy, and diastolic heart failure. Case 2 patient. A 82-year-old male who presented with shortness of breath, stenosis of the coronary artery (LAD), severe atherosclerosis of the aortic valve, and a thin aortic root. Case 3 patient. A 40-year-old female who presented with aortic valve murmur and worsening aortic stenosis of her BAV. Case 4 patient. A 75-year-old male who presented with a history of heart failure, two surgeries involving a coronary artery bypass graft, aortic stenosis, COPD, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, atrial fibrillation, and who had a biventricular ICD. Case 5 patient. A 61-year-old African-American female who presented with angina and dyspnea with exertion, aortic stenosis, and a history of coronary artery disease and stents. Case 6 patient. A 44-year-old female who presented with a congenital abnormality in her aortic valve, which was accompanied with severe aortic stenosis. Case 7 patient. A 76-year-old female who presented with nonischemic cardiomyopathy, lowered ejection fraction, and who had a biventricular ICD. ARE was done by utilizing the Nick's procedure to increase the size of the aortic valve implantation. The annular size was increased by extending the aortotomy down to the noncoronary sinus and traversing the annulus down to the anterior leaflet of the mitral valve ( ,B). The aortic valve prosthesis was then implanted into the enlarged annulus, the patch was then used to augment the aortic root to ensure no impingement on the bioprosthetic, and the defect in the annulus was closed with the CorMatrix ECM patch strut (
