A 31-year-old woman with prosthetic mitral valve due to rheumatic heart disease presented to the emergency room with acute bilateral lower extremities pain, coldness and paresthesia. Physical exam revealed temperature of 102.4 F, heart rate of 120, holosystolic murmur and absent pedal pulses in both foot. Rest of the physical exam was unremarkable. Basic laboratory findings were within normal limits. Chest X-ray examination and initial Electrocardiogram (ECG) were normal. Computerized tomography angiogram (CTA) revealed complete occlusion of the right common iliac and proximal left femoral artery. She underwent emergent bilateral embolectomy with significant improvement of her symptoms. After surgery, foot perfusion was normal and distal pulses were present. Patient was admitted to the medical floor afterward for further work up. Transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) showed 19 Ã‚ 12 mm protruding, mobile vegetation in the mitral valve with severe mitral regurgitation . Due to large vegetation on echocardiogram, prosthetic mitral valve, history of injectable drug abuse and bilateral embolism, fungal PVE was suspected and therefore, patient underwent mitral valve replacement. Cultures and samples of the arterial emboli, prosthetic valve and three previously performed blood cultures yielded C. parapsilosis , and treatment with intravenous Amphotericin B was initiated. Subsequently, patient was discharged with long-term prescription of fluconazole.
