A 43-year-old male, obese, former-smoker patient was suffering from gout and had been anticoagulated by pulmonary thromboembolism for 1 year when he developed progressive dyspnea without anginal complaints. He was directed to a tertiary hospital for investigation of heart failure. Through echocardiographic evaluation, severe biventricular diffuse systolic dysfunction with suspicion of noncompacted cardiomyopathy was identified, even though such a hypothesis could not be confirmed gadolinium enhancement at 2/17 segments (mid-anteroseptal and apical septal). Coronary computed tomography angiogram showed a calcified nonobstructive plaque in the proximal left anterior descending coronary artery . In 2008, according to Fazio et al., NCC does not present thromboembolic risk and there is no indication for anticoagulation . On the other hand, nowadays, the indication for anticoagulation treatment in NCC is still debatable. Almeida et al. recommended anticoagulation only in cases of left ventricular dilation and dysfunction or with previous embolic events . Recently, St√∂llberger and Finsterer stated that thrombi may also develop in patients with NCC even with preserved systolic function . It is generally recommended to those presenting ventricular systolic dysfunction, antecedent of systemic embolism, presence of cardiac thrombus and atrial fibrillation . CMRI plays a crucial role in the diagnosis of left ventricular noncompaction, especially for its accuracy in detecting ventricular thrombi. No prospective study demonstrates the benefits of anticoagulation in NCC patients, which generates uncertainty and insecurity, because there are reports of patients without ventricular dysfunction or atrial fibrillation who have suffered a systemic thromboembolism.
