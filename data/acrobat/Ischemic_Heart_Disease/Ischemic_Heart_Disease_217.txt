The initial evaluation of acute chest pain requires an ECG and cardiac biomarkers . 11 Patients at very low risk for CAD and those with an alternative explanation for their symptoms require no further testing. Conversely, those with a high pretest probability for CAD may benefit from
( In patients selected to undergo CTA, preparation with β-blockers and breathing instructions are paramount for achieving high image quality, although some scanners now permit rapid image acquisition, obviating the need for aggressive heart rate control. largebore (≈18 gauge) intravenous access is preferred for high-flow contrast administration. Unless contraindicated, all patients receive nitroglycerin before scanning.
Given the intermediate pretest probability of obstructive CAD and the absence of contraindications, the patient underwent CTA, demonstrating mild nonobstructive CAD . A second set of cardiac biomarkers was normal. He was discharged with follow-up for risk factor management and has remained free of adverse cardiac events.
