Myers et al.
retrospectively studied 224 patients undergoing LAD open-CE with SV patch, ITA bypass graft or ITA-onlay graft reconstruction. The postoperative mortality rate was 3.6% (8/224), with a 4.1% incidence of MI (9/224) in the LAD territory. In their retrospective series of 37 patients undergoing open-CE to the LAD with ITA-onlay reconstruction, Kato et al. observed 2.7% mortality (1/37), 5.4% (2/37) stroke and 2.7% (1/37) postoperative MI. Fukui et al.
retrospectively studied 67 patients who underwent open-CE to the LAD with ITA-onlay reconstruction. Off-pump CE was performed in 71.6% (48/67). The postoperative mortality rate was 4.5% (3/67) with a high incidence of MI (14.9%; 10/67). High rates of postoperative AF (20.9%; 14/67) and blood transfusion (50.7%; 34/67) were also observed.inclusion or exclusion criteria. Angiography was performed only in a small proportion of patients AF: atrial fibrillation; CABG: coronary artery bypass grafting; CCF: congestive cardiac failure; CCS: Canadian Cardiovascular Society grading of angina; CE: coronary endarterectomy; CO: cardiac output; CVA: cerebrovascular accident; Cx: circumflex coronary artery; D: diagonal coronary artery; DCAD: diffuse coronary artery disease; EF: ejection fraction; GA: gastroepiploic artery; IABP: intra-aortic balloon pump; ITA: internal thoracic artery; ICU: intensive care unit; LAD: left anterior descending coronary artery; LITA: left internal thoracic artery; LMWH: low molecular weight heparin; MI: myocardial infarction; NYHA: New York Heart Association Functional Classification; OPCAB: off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting; RA: radial artery; RCA: right coronary artery; SV: saphenous vein; VF: ventricular fibrillation; VT: ventricular tachycardia. Tasdemir et al. retrospectively studied 61 patients undergoing open-CE to the LAD with SV patch and ITA bypass graft, SV-onlay graft or ITA-onlay graft reconstruction. The postoperative mortality rate was 6.5% (4/61) with MI occurring in 8.1% (5/61). The MI rate in the endarterectomized LAD territory was lower at 1.6% (1/61). Sankar et al.
retrospectively studied 69 patients undergoing open-CE to the LAD with either SV-onlay graft or ITA-onlay graft reconstruction. The postoperative mortality rate was 10.1% (7/69), with an MI incidence rate of 4.3% (3/69). In their retrospective series of 106 patients, undergoing open-CE to the LAD with either ITA-onlay graft or SV patch and ITA bypass, Christenson et al. observed an overall mortality rate of 9.4% (10/106). Mortality was significantly lower with the ITA (5%) bypass conduit compared with the SV (12.1%). Two-vessel CE conferred a higher mortality (36.4%) than single-vessel CE (6.3%). The incidence rates of MI and CVA were 6.6% (7/106) and 1.9% (2/106), respectively. MI rates were lower in patients receiving ITA as the bypass conduit. Beretta et al.
retrospectively studied 96 patients who underwent open-CE to the LAD (74), right coronary artery (RCA) (22) and circumflex artery (CA) (4) with SV patch and ITA bypass graft or SV-onlay graft reconstruction. The overall mortality rate was 5.2% (5/96) but this was lower (2.1%) with the ITA bypass conduit when compared with the SV (8%). Two-vessel CE conferred a higher mortality (11.7%) than one-vessel CE (3.7%). Postoperative MI (6.3%) and neurological injury (2%) were lower in patients receiving ITA (2.1 and 0%, respectively) as the bypass conduit. Sommerhaug et al. retrospectively studied 130 patients undergoing open-CE to the LAD (121), RCA (18) and CA (13) with SV or ITA bypass graft reconstruction. Overall 30-day mortality was 2.3% (3/130), with a low incidence of MI 1.5% (2/130).
