A 50-year-old man was admitted to the hospital with left shoulder and arm discomfort in 2013. The discomfort was not associated with any chest pain or shortness of breath. The pain was worse in the elbow area, and he had tenderness to palpation in the posterior shoulder. The pain showed no sign of improvement over a period of 3 days, and the patient was admitted to rule out acute coronary syndrome. He had no recent history of change in his energy level, limitations to activity, exertional chest pain, or shortness of breath. The patient had cardiac risk factors, including a strong family history of premature coronary artery disease and dyslipidemia. No other familial risk factors for acute coronary syndrome were noted. He did not smoke and denied any history of hypertension or diabetes. The patient had no history of drug abuse and reported medications included only naproxen, multivitamin, omeprazole, and Lactobacillus supplements. Of note, he had a syncopal episode in 2003 with a positive troponin I, but had a negative cardiac workup, including cardiac catheterization that showed luminal irregularities and no significant coronary artery disease. Upon admission, the patient's troponin I was negative. An electrocardiogram revealed poor anterior R-wave progression. An echocardiogram showed mildly decreased global left ventricular systolic function with an ejection fraction of 40% with akinetic apex and hypokinetic apical septal, apical lateral, apical anterior, and apical inferior segments. Baseline regional wall motion abnormalities indicated cardiac catheterization rather than stress echocardiogram. Cardiac catheterization showed a normal left main artery, but the left anterior descending artery had ostial and very complex proximal and mid dissection with the appearance of multiple lumens (
. A large first diagonal branch also had a long area of dissection. The circumflex artery was free of significant
