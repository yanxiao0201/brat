A 48 year old Sinhalese man from Chillaw, Sri Lanka presented to his local hospital with a history of sudden onset retrosternal chest pain, shortness of breath and sweating. He was a heavy alcohol abuser, consuming 10 Units of Local Arrack (Ethanol) on a daily basis with occasional use of illicit alcohol (Methanol). An ECG taken at the local hospital is seen in . It was suggestive of an Acute Inferior ST Elevation Myocardial Infarction. In the absence of any known complications and as interventional facilities were not available at that centre, he was thrombolysed with IV streptokinase. As the patient had persistent chest pain and unresolved ST segment changes, he was transferred to the National Hospital of Sri Lanka for further management. A retrospective history revealed the patient had repetitively vomited prior to his initial presentation preceded by heavy alcohol consumption. Examination revealed muffled heart sounds and a pericardial friction rub. An immediate bedside 2 Dimensional Echocardiogram was performed which had poor echo windows but a moderate pericardial effusion was identified with no clear evidence of tamponade. There was no significant regional wall motion abnormalities. A Chest X-Ray â€“ Antero-Posterior View was performed  which was followed by a Contrast Computer Tomography Chest . An urgent pericardial aspiration evacuated 800 millilitres of frank pus and a diagnosis of pneumopyopericardium was made. In search of a possible aetiology, a Gastrograffin study was performed . An immediate surgical referral was made which was followed by endoscopic covered stent placement. Intravenous meropenem was commenced pending culture reports. Troponin I titres were negative. A coronary angiogram was not performed on the patient due to high risk and haemodynamic instability. Unfortunately, two days after treatment at the coronary care unit, the patient developed a cardiac arrest and expired.
