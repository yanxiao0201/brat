An 80-year-old woman was admitted to our emergency department with comatose at presentation. Physical examination revealed a prompt pupillary light reflex with both pupils of size of 3 mm, an occipital scalp haematoma and flaccid extremities. Electrocardiography showed ST-segment elevation in V2â€“ V5, I, aVL and reciprocal ST-segment depression in the inferior leads, consistent with the typical findings of acute anterolateral STEMI . Because of her comatose status, the authors were uncertain whether the STEMI resulted in coma, which caused head trauma or ST-segment change was secondary to the head trauma. Therefore, both follow-up ECG and cranial computed tomography (CT) were arranged. Twenty minutes later, while waiting for the CT, a follow-up ECG revealed complete resolution of the ST-segment elevation, thus allowed us to derive the preliminary diagnosis of ICH-related ST-segment elevation . The CT scan revealed bilateral SAH and right subdural haemorrhage with midline shift  and supported our preliminary diagnosis.

Under the impression of ICHrelated ST-segment elevation, emergent coronary catheterization was not performed. However, the patient died within 24 hours of initial presentation because of severe brain oedema.
