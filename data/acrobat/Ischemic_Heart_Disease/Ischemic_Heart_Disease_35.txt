A 57-year-old male smoker with history of hypercholesterolemia and a family history of coronary artery disease was referred for coronary angiography due to recurrent chest pain and a positive exercise test. Coronary angiography showed triple-vessel disease with tandem lesions of the LAD with good distal runoff. A high diagonal branch had an ostial lesion with good distal run-off . The left circumflex and right coronary artery had significant mid-level lesions with good distal run-off. On-pump total arterial revascularization was performed with sequential left IMA grafting to the diagonal branch (side-to-side) and LAD (end-to-side), a pedicled right IMA graft to the first obtuse marginal branch, and a sequential radial artery graft to the distal right coronary artery (sideto-side) and the second obtuse marginal branch (endto-side). The patient had an uneventful postoperative stay. He was placed on aspirin, statin, and beta-blocker therapy. Twenty-one months later, he was readmitted for angiography because of a new onset of chest discomfort. Coronary angiography showed that the right IMA and the sequential radial artery grafts had all distal anastomoses patent. The left IMA had a string sign before the diagonal anastomosis, and the distalsegment between the diagonal branch and the LAD was perfused through the diagonal branch with a patent LAD anastomosis with good distal LAD filling . The decision was made to optimize medical treatment. At the time of this report, the patient was clinically stable on increased dosages of his medications: aspirin 80 mg daily, atorvastatin 20 mg daily, and metoprolol 25 mg twice daily.
