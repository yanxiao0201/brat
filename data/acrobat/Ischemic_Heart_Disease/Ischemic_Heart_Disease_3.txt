A 58-year-old previously healthy woman presented with multiple bee stings while she was returning home. She was admitted to hospital in Jaffna within 20 minutes of the incident. On admission more than 300 bee sting marks were noted all over her body and 16 live bees were found under her clothing and were removed. On admission she did not complain of chest pain, shortness of breath, wheezing or palpitation, nor was there evidence of an altered level of consciousness. Her pulse rate was 96 bpm and her blood pressure was 110/70 mmHg with a respiratory rate of 16/min. Her saturation at room air was 98%.showed ST segment depression in V2â€“V4 . The cardiac marker troponin I was positive (0.766 u/L). She was immediately treated with intravenous hydrocortisone 100 mg and thereafter 6-hourly along with Chlorpheniramine. She was managed with dual anti-platelet drugs, atorvastatin and enoxaparin. Within 24 hours, the ECG changes reverted to normal and she did not complain chest pain thereafter. A two-dimensional (2D) ECG was normal (no regional wall motion defects and normal ejection fraction).
Polyuria which started on day 2 of admission settled after 48 hours. A coronary angiogram revealed normal epicardial coronary arteries and consequently all the anti-anginal drugs were discontinued.
