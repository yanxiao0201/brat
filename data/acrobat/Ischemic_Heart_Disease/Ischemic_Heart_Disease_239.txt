A 71-year–old man with hypertension, dyslipidemia, and type 2 diabetes mellitus noticed intermittent claudication in both legs in 2003. He received endovascular treatment of the left iliac artery in 2003 and that of the right iliac artery in 2008. The symptom, however, recurred in 2010, and medical treatment failed to improve it. He received another endovascular treatment for the right SFA. Control angiography revealed a short total occlusion in the right SFA ( and Movies I and II in the online-only Data Supplement). We decided to approach the CTO both antegradely and retrogradely according to the previous report. 3 Under an adequate anticoagulation with heparin, we observed proximal and distal sides of CTO of the SFA with angioscopy. It showed the presence of white, red, and mixed thrombi over the light yellow plaques ( through 1D and Movies III through V in the onlineonly Data Supplement) on the distal side of the CTO, but there was no thrombus on the proximal side. After the angioscopic examination, we implanted stents, and the angiography thereafter showed no sign of thromboembolism.
A 76-year–old woman with hypertension, dyslipidemia, and chronic atrial fibrillation noticed intermittent claudication in both legs after a 100-meter walk in 2008. Medical treatment was started without effect, leaving progression of the leg pain after a 40-meter walk. A diagnostic angiography revealed a long total occlusion of the left SFA ( and Movie VI in the online-only Data Supplement) in January 2013. One month later, an angioscopic examination was performed as described above before conducting endovascular treatment for the lesion. It showed the presence of white and red thrombi over the dark yellow plaques ( and 2C and Movies VII and VIII in the online-only Data Supplement) on the distal side of the CTO, whereas it showed no thrombus in the proximal side. We implanted stents in the lesion, and the postprocedural angiography showed no sign of thromboembolism.
