A 57-year-old man presented with acute right ventricular infarction. After insertion of an IABP, emergency catheterization revealed total occlusion of the right coronary artery, 90% stenosis of the left main trunk, and 75% stenosis of the left anterior descending and circumflex branches. A percutaneous coronary intervention was immediately performed on the right coronary artery to aspirate dark red thrombi. Despite balloon hemostasis, persistent extravasation necessitated an emergency thoracotomy. After admission to the intensive care unit on the same day, the patient developed severe right ventricular infarction. Reduced blood pressure, elevated central venous pressure, and shock, despite intravenous fluid loading and inotropic support, necessitated initiation of ECMO support (Capiox EBS circuit integrated with an LX oxygenator; Terumo, Tokyo, Japan) in the intensive care unit. Five days later, he seemed to require long-term ECMO management. Consequently, coronary artery bypass was performed (great saphenous vein-left anterior descending branch, great saphenous vein-left circumflex branch), ECMO support was discontinued, and a right VAD (Abiomed BVS 5000; Abiomed, Inc., Danvers, MA, USA) was implanted . Bleeding from the drainage tube stabilized by the 24th postoperative hour, and anticoagulant therapy with heparin was initiated (target activated coagulation time, 200 s). Circulation gradually stabilized, allowing inotropic dose reduction. Echocardiography indicated improved cardiac function. The right VAD was therefore removed after 5 days in place. Since then, the patient has been followed up as an outpatient, with no signs of heart failure or infection for 9 months post-surgery.
