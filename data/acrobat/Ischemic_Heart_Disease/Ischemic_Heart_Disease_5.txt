A 67-year-old man who experienced severe chest pain for a day, was admitted to the emergency room in a state of cardiogenic shock. On arrival, he was pale with a systolic blood pressure of 70 mm Hg and heart rate of 80 beatsÁmin À1. Electrocardiography showed normal sinus rhythm and ST elevation in leads V1–V6, II, III, and aVf. Assuming acute myocardial infarction, emergency coronary angiography was performed, which showed total occlusion of the left anterior descending artery (LAD) and severe stenosis of the proximal right coronary artery (RCA). A percutaneous coronary intervention was undertaken to revascularize the LAD . Although it was successful, the patient's hemodynamics remained unstable. Echocardiography revealed an echo-free space in the pericardial cavity. Therefore, percutaneous pericardial drainage was carried out. Continuous bleeding occurred, and dark blood was drained. Free wall rupture secondary to myocardial infarction was suspected, and the patient was immediately taken to the operating room. A median sternotomy was performed, and when the pericardium was incised, 300 mL of blood burst out from the pericardial cavity. Cardiac wall motion of the apex was dyskinetic, and that of the anterior wall was hypokinetic. After cardiopulmonary bypass was established, further exploration of the heart revealed a 3 Â 4-mm area of free wall rupture in the right side of the LAD . Direct closure of the rupture was achieved by placing 2 mattress sutures with pledgets . To manage the severe stenosis of the proximal RCA, a reversed autogenous saphenous vein graft was placed on the distal RCA. The patient was weaned from cardiopulmonary bypass uneventfully. He recovered well, and was discharged on the 17th postoperative day.
