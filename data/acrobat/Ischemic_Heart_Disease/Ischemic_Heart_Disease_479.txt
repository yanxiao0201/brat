The patient was administered a regimen of aspirin and atorvastatin. A CCTA demonstrated 3-vessel obstructive CAD. A PET-MPI was obtained to determine the magnitude of ischemia and the role of revascularization. Testing identified severe ischemia in the distribution of the left anterior descending and circumflex arteries. The patient underwent a coronary angiogram and subsequent coronary artery bypass graft surgery. He tolerated the procedure well and has resumed exercising. Although routine acquisition of both CCTA and MPI is usually not required, the data from both examinations aided this patient's decision between medical therapy and revascularization.
