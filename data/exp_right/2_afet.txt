A 54-year-old woman presented with giant struma , hyperthyroidism of unknown duration , palpitations and dyspnoea . The ECG showed tachycardia atrial fibrillation . Echocardiography revealed dilatation of the left ventricle , highly reduced systolic function and diffuse hypokinesia . Serum thyroid stimulating hormone -LRB- TSH -RRB- levels were less than 0.03 lU/ml -LRB- physiological range 0.554.78 lU / ml -RRB- , free triiodothyronine -LRB- fT3 -RRB- was 7.32 pg/ml -LRB- 2.304.20 pg/ml -RRB- and free thyroxine -LRB- fT4 -RRB- amounted to Fig . 1 Turbo field-echo -LRB- TFE -RRB- inversion recovery -LRB- IR -RRB- sequences in vertical -LRB- a -RRB- and horizontal -LRB- b -RRB- long axis 10 min after intravenous gadolinium-based contrast agent administration : the healthy basal and midventricular myocardium shows no prolonged gadolinium retention and is depicted in black -LRB- arrowheads -RRB- , whereas the transmural scar in the apical segments retains the gadolinium and has a bright appearance -LRB- arrows -RRB- . Auxiliary finding of bilateral pleural effusions -LRB- asterisk -RRB-
