A 39-year-old obese woman presented with influenza A -LRB- H1N1 -RRB- - related acute respiratory distress syndrome -LRB- ARDS -RRB- . At day 2 , refractory hypoxemia ensued and veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation -LRB- ECMO -RRB- was initiated . At day 15 , venous catheter-related infection was suspected and a left subclavian venous catheter was inserted using the Seldinger technique , with blood that was freely aspirated before and after insertion of the catheter . However , acute circulatory shock was observed shortly afterwards . The transthoracic echocardiogram revealed pericardial effusion with collapsed right chambers , suggesting cardiac tamponade . The chest X-ray -LRB- Fig . 1 -RRB- showed a malposi-tioned catheter in the left lung . Cardiac arrest ensued and emergent sternotomy was performed under ECMO-assisted cardiopulmonary resuscitation after femoral artery cannu-lation -LRB- venous-venous-arterial ECMO -RRB- . Pulmonary artery perforation -LRB- Fig . 2 -RRB- and hemopericardium were then surgically repaired after catheter withdrawal . Her hospital course was further complicated by severe ARDS secondary to Enterococcus faecalis bacteremia with redo veno-venous ECMO . The patient made a full recovery and was discharged home 2.5 months after hospital admission with no neuro-logic or cardiopulmonary sequelae .
